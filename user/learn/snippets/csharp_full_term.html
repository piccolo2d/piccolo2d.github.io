// Returns the bounding box of the given node without the node's
// transform applied.
aNode.Bounds;

// Returns the bounds of the given node combined with the bounds of
// all of the descendants of that node after applying the node's
// transform. Descendants need not be contained in the bounds of
// their parent, so this full bounds value may be larger than the
// bounds, but it will never be smaller.
aNode.FullBounds;

// This will paint just &quot;aNode&quot; and not any of its children. Normally this
// method is automatically called from the FullPaint method.
aNode.Paint(aPaintContext);

// This will paint &quot;aNode&quot; together will all of that node's descendents.
aNode.FullPaint(aPaintContext);
