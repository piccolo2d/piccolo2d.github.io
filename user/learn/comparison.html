          Piccolo in Comparison
        </h1>Why should you use Piccolo and which version should you use? This section will cover
        the differences between Piccolo.Java, Piccolo.NET, and PocketPiccolo.NET.&nbsp; In
        addition, there will be discussions of the differences between Piccolo and Jazz&nbsp;(our
        previous toolkit) and how Piccolo relates to other available toolkits.
      </div>
      <h2>
        Piccolo.Java, Piccolo.NET and PocketPiccolo.NET
      </h2>
      <p>
        There three versions of Piccolo: <em>Piccolo.Java</em>, <em>Piccolo.NET</em>, and
        <em>PocketPiccolo.NET</em>. They contain the same core functionality with a few
        differences.&nbsp; We will examine those differences here.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Languages, Libraries and IDEs
      </h3>
      <p>
        Piccolo.Java is written in 100% java and relies on the
        <a href='http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/2D/'>Java2D</a> API for graphics
        rendering.&nbsp; Applications built on Piccolo.Java will run anywhere java will run
        (including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Solaris).&nbsp; The recommended development
        environment for Piccolo.Java is <a href='http://www.eclipse.org/'>Eclipse</a>, although it
        is possible to use Piccolo.Java without an IDE.
      </p>
      <p>
        Piccolo.NET, on the other hand, is written in C# and relies on the
        <a href='http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/gdicpp/GDIPlus/GDIPlus.asp'>
        GDI+</a> API for graphics rendering.&nbsp; It runs on platforms that support the .NET
        Framework.&nbsp; However, currently only Windows machines implement the Common Language
        Runtime (CLR).&nbsp; So, If you really want your application to be cross-platform you
        should use Piccolo.Java.&nbsp; On the other hand, the advantage of using Piccolo.NET is
        that it will allow you to easily integrate advanced 2D graphics and zooming with standard
        Windows application code and platform-specific features.&nbsp; The recommended development
        environment for Piccolo.NET is Visual Studio.NET.
      </p>
      <p>
        PocketPiccolo.NET is also written in C#.&nbsp; It runs on platforms that support the .NET
        Compact Framework (including Pocket PCs, Pocket PC Phones, Smart Phones, and Windows CE.NET
        devices).&nbsp; There is no equivalent to GDI+ for the Compact Framework.&nbsp; Thus,
        PocketPiccolo.NET is limited by the primitive drawing routines available through the
        Compact Framework.&nbsp; See the <a href='#features'>Features</a> section for more
        details.&nbsp; As with Piccolo.NET, the recommended development environment for
        PocketPiccolo.NET is Visual Studio.NET.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Speed/Memory
      </h3>
      <p>
        In terms of both speed and memory usage, Piccolo.Java and Piccolo.NET are comparable.&nbsp;
        While earlier versions of .NET had slower image rendering performance than Java, we have
        not done any direct comparisons in several years.&nbsp; In practice, we find Java and C# to
        have similar rendering performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since performance is critical in a graphics toolkit, we provide framework support for
        plugging in other more powerful renderers.&nbsp; The
        <a href='../download/index.html#Source'>current release</a> of Piccolo.NET includes an
        implementation of a
        <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/default.aspx'>Direct3D</a> renderer
        package.&nbsp; For better performance with Piccolo.Java, you can use
        <a href='http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/agile2d/'>Agile2D</a>, which includes a pluggable
        <a href='http://www.opengl.org/'>OpenGL</a> implementation of Java2D.
      </p>
      <p>
        PocketPiccolo.NET is our first alpha release targeting the .NET Compact framework.&nbsp; As
        such, it has not yet been optimized for performance.
      </p>
      <h3 id='features'>
        Features
      </h3>
      <p>
        Piccolo.Java and Piccolo.NET support virtually the same feature set.&nbsp; This makes it
        very easy port code from one version to the other. There are however a couple exceptions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Transparency - Piccolo.NET does not have built-in support for transparency since .NET
          does not provide a mechanism to set a global alpha composite. You can of course still use
          transparent fills on nodes.
        </li>
        <li>
          PStyledText - This is a node used to render styled text data at various magnitudes.&nbsp;
          It is available in Piccolo.Java, but not Piccolo.NET
        </li>
        <li>
          PStyledTextEventHandler - This is an event handler that places a text editor on the
          screen when a user clicks on a PStyledText node, in order to edit the underlying
          text.&nbsp; It is available in Piccolo.Java, but not Piccolo.NET.
        </li>
        <li>
          PLine - This is an implementation of a line node, very similar to PPath, that was
          submitted by a Piccolo user.&nbsp; It is available in Piccolo.Java, but not
          Piccolo.NET.&nbsp; However, if someone ports and submits a Piccolo.NET version we will
          include it in the source.
        </li>
        <li>
          SWT Package - This is a set of classes to help integrate Piccolo code into the Eclipse
          development environment.&nbsp; It is available in Piccolo.Java, but not Piccolo.NET.
        </li>
        <li>
          PFixedWidthStroke - This is stroke class that always has a fixed width on screen, even
          when the canvas view is zoomed.&nbsp; It is available in Piccolo.Java, but not
          Piccolo.NET since there is no simple way to implement a Pen in .NET.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          PiccoloDirect3D - This is an implementation of Piccolo that uses a Direct3D
          renderer.&nbsp; It available in Piccolo.NET, but not Piccolo.Java.&nbsp; However, you can
          use <a href='http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/agile2d/'>Agile2D</a> to plug in an OpenGl
          renderer for Piccolo.Java.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serialization Surrogates - These are several classes that define how to serialize certain
          types, to avoid duplicating serialization code.&nbsp; These are available in Piccolo.NET,
          but not Piccolo.Java.&nbsp; Piccolo.Java uses utility methods to achieve the same effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          PControl - This is a PNode wrapper for standard controls, allowing you to embed existing
          widgets (i.e. buttons, textboxes, etc.) in the scene-graph.&nbsp; It is available in
          Piccolo.NET, but not Piccolo.Java
        </li>
        <li>
          PControlEventHandler - This is an event handler that implements focused based navigation
          for PControl nodes.&nbsp; It is available in Piccolo.NET, but not Piccolo.Java
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Just as the .NET Compact Framework is a subset of the .NET Framework, PocketPiccolo.NET is
        a subset of Piccolo.NET.&nbsp; It has the same core features: hierarchical transformable
        objects, animation, event handling and efficiency mechanisms.&nbsp; But, some features of
        the desktop versions are not available:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          High Quality Rendering - This refers to aliasing and other techniques that improve the
          quality of the rendering.&nbsp; These optimizations are not available in
          PocketPiccolo.NET since they are not supported by the Compact Framework.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transparency - This is unavailable in PocketPiccolo.NET since the Compact Framework does
          not support transparency.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rotation - This is unavailable in PocketPiccolo.NET since the Compact Framework does not
          support rotation.
        </li>
        <li>
          PPath - This is a graphical path node in the desktop versions of Piccolo. In
          Piccolo.Java, PPath wraps the
          <a href='http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/awt/geom/GeneralPath.html'>GeneralPath</a>
          object and in Piccolo.NET, it wraps the
          <a href='http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemdrawingdrawing2dgraphicspathclasstopic.asp'>
          GraphicsPath</a> object.&nbsp; Since there is no equivalent class to wrap in the Compact
          Framework, PPath is very limited.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        API
      </h3>
      <p>
        The APIs for the various versions of Piccolo will all feel similar.&nbsp; In fact, the
        PocketPiccolo.NET API is mostly identical to the Piccolo.NET API, except that some of the
        classes and methods of the desktop version are unavailable.&nbsp; There are also some
        differences between Piccolo.NET and Piccolo.Java that reflect an effort to support the
        individual style guidelines and language constructs of Java and C#.
      </p>
      <p>
        Method names, for example, begin with a lower-case letter in Piccolo.Java and an upper-case
        letter in both Piccolo.NET and PocketPiccolo.NET.&nbsp; For example, the method that
        animates a node from it's current position and size to a new position and size is
        <code>animateToBounds()</code> in Piccolo.Java and <code>AnimateToBounds()</code> in
        Piccolo.NET and PocketPiccolo.NET.
      </p>
      <p>
        Member attributes are also accessed differently in each API.&nbsp; For example, in
        Piccolo.Java, attributes are accessed via get/set methods.&nbsp; But, Piccolo.NET and
        PocketPiccolo.NET take advantage of language supported
        <a href='http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/csref/html/vclrfUsingProperties.asp'>
        Properties</a>. For example, to access the bounds of a node in each version you would do
        the following:
      </p>
      <table summary='Code look'>
        <tr>
          <td>
            //Piccolo.Java
          </td>
          <td>
            //Piccolo.NET and PocketPiccolo.NET
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <code>node.getBounds()</code>
          </td>
          <td>
            <code>node.Bounds</code>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        The APIs also differ in terms of the underlying types they use.&nbsp; Often the Java and
        .NET names of equivalent classes are different.&nbsp; For example, Java has Paint and
        Stroke classes whereas .NET has Brush and Pen classes.&nbsp; Another example is the affine
        transform type, which is called AffineTransform in java and Matrix in .NET. The names of
        Piccolo methods also reflect these differences.&nbsp; For example, the method to animate a
        node to an arbitrary affine transform is <code>animateToTransform()</code> in Piccolo.Java
        and <code>AnimateToMatrix()</code> in Piccolo.NET and PocketPiccolo.NET.
      </p>
      <p>
        One very important distinction related to types has to do with how the bounds of a node is
        stored.&nbsp; In Piccolo.Java there is a PBounds type which extends
        <a href='http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/awt/geom/Rectangle2D.Double.html'>Rectangle2D.Double</a>,
        adding several useful methods. But, the corresponding
        <a href='http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemdrawingrectanglefclasstopic.asp'>
        RectangleF</a> type in .NET cannot be extended.&nbsp; This left us with two choices: create
        a PBounds class that wraps a RectangleF or use the RectangleF directly.&nbsp; We decided it
        would be more straightforward to store the bounds as RectangleF objects.&nbsp; Thus, we
        provide the same methods of Piccolo.Java's PBounds as static utility methods in
        Piccolo.NET.
      </p>
      <p>
        The versions of piccolo differ in the primitive types they use too.&nbsp; Since the Java2D
        API uses doubles, Piccolo.Java also stores internal values (e.g. x, y, width, height) as
        doubles.&nbsp; The GDI+ API on the other hand uses floats.&nbsp; So, Piccolo.NET stores
        these same values as floats.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Another language difference reflected in Piccolo is that Java provides <i>anonymous inner
        classes</i> while C# has <i>delegates</i>. The Piccolo.Java API does not enforce the use of
        anonymous inner classes, but, often it is the easiest way to do things.&nbsp; For example,
        using anonymous inner classes, you could create a new type of
        <code>PBasicInputEventHandler</code> in place and override just the
        <code>mousePressed</code> method.&nbsp; In Piccolo.NET, you would have to create a named
        static class that extends <code>PBasicInputEventHandler</code> to do the same thing.&nbsp;
        This could vastly increase the amount of code you have to write.&nbsp; So, Piccolo.NET
        provides delegates as a shorthand. This allows you to instantiate a
        <code>PBasicInputEventHandler</code>, and then attach your event handler method directly to
        it's <code>MouseDown</code> delegate.&nbsp; For code examples see the

        Piccolo and Jazz
      </h2>
      <p>
        Jazz was our previous ZUI toolkit.&nbsp; The following section outlines the major
        differences between Piccolo and Jazz.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Ease of Use
      </h3>
      <p>
        Our goal with Piccolo was to create a ZUI that had a similar feature set to Jazz, but that
        was easier to use from a programmers standpoint. Almost all the differences between Piccolo
        and Jazz are changes that are meant to make Piccolo easier to use.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Complexity
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Jazz framework design is modeled after a 3D scene graph API. It contains many different
        types of object, each with specific functionality, and these objects are designed to be put
        together at runtime to produce more complicated objects. This gives the framework
        flexibility, but requires many different classes and levels of abstraction to support,
        making it more difficult to use. For example to create a moveable rectangle with Jazz you
        will need:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          ZRectangle
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This is the ZVisualComponent abstraction
        </dd>
        <dt>
          ZVisualLeaf
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This is a ZNode that is used to place a ZVisualComponent into a scene graph
        </dd>
        <dt>
          ZTransformGroup
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This is a decorator on the ZVisuallLeaf that gives it the ability to be scaled and
          translated.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Piccolo takes a different more traditional 2D approach. There is no separation between
        ZVisualComponents and ZNodes. So the Piccolo version of a rectangle extends directly from
        PNode and can be place directly into a scene graph without needing to be wrapped in a
        ZVisualLeaf type object. Piccolo has also built many of the most common decorator classes
        used in Jazz directly into the PNode class. For example every PNode has a affine transform,
        supports children, and can have its transparency set. So in Piccolo to create a movable
        rectangle all you need is a:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          PPath
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This class represents a graphics path and is used to draw all shapes. It extends from
          PNode so it has a transform, may have child nodes added to it and all the rest.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Since the Piccolo is a complete rewrite, and a smaller code base we also put a lot of time
        into making the Piccolo source code as readable and strait forward as possible. It's our
        hope that this should make it much easier to add your own new features to Piccolo then it
        was to do with Jazz.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Speed/Memory
      </h3>
      <p>
        The speed differences between Piccolo and Jazz for most applications are not large, most
        time is still spent painting with Java's Graphics2D. With that said Piccolo has made
        significant improvements in the time required to manipulate the scene graph. So if your
        program is moving around larger numbers of nodes at the same time then Piccolo should be
        faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        It turns out that for most cases Piccolo uses less memory then Jazz. Since instead of
        needing three different objects to support the normal situation of a movable visible object
        it only needs one. This together with better bounds management also makes it much faster to
        create a large number of new objects in Piccolo then in Jazz.
      </p>
      <p>
        The piccolo.jar size is approximately 65k, while the jazz.jar was about 450k. So for applet
        based applications the Piccolo framework will be much faster to download over the web.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Features
      </h3>
      <p>
        Piccolo and Jazz support the same basic feature set. They both have structured graphics,
        and cameras that can look onto that structure using a view transform. So you should be able
        to build anything in Piccolo that was possible in Jazz. At the moment their are some
        specific features that we have not ported over to Piccolo from Jazz yet:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          ZAnchorGroup
        </dt>
        <dd>
          used to specify hyperlinks
        </dd>
        <dt>
          ZClipGroup
        </dt>
        <dd>
          used to specify a clip group around it children nodes
        </dd>
        <dt>
          ZConstraintGroup
        </dt>
        <dd>
          used to constrain a transform based on some calculation. See Piccolo Patterns for an
          easier way to do this in Piccolo.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          ZFadeGroup
        </dt>
        <dd>
          all piccolo nodes support transparency, something that ZFadeGroup was used for. But
          ZFadeGroup also supported automatically changing an objects transparency based on scale
          that it was being viewed at.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Layout managers
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Piccolo doesn't come with any layout managers, but all PNodes have a method
          layoutChildren() that is easily overridden and will get called for you automatically when
          the size of any of the children changes.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          ZSelectionGroup
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Used by Jazz's selection management system.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          ZSpatialIndex
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Used for efficient picking and culling objects that won't be painted. Not having this
          effects speed very little if at all since the vast majority of time is spent painting
          objects, not culling or picking them.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          ZSwing
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Piccolo does not support embedding Swing objects into the PCanvas.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Any needed features should be fairly easy to port to Piccolo, please let us know if you
        need something and well do our best to include it. We will put most of these features in
        piccolox (Piccolo extras) so that if we do add them the don't complicate Piccolo's core
        classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jazz has some features that will most likely never be supported by Piccolo
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          Text file format
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Our recommendation is that applications that need a file format should use define their
          own and it will make life much easier for everyone. Piccolo does support Java
          serialization for short term persistence.
        </dd>

        Piccolo and Other Toolkits
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are numerous graphical toolkits available.&nbsp; This section will explain how
        Piccolo fits in with the myriad of other available toolkits.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Structured Architecture
      </h3>
      <p>
        Piccolo is a toolkit for building structured 2D graphics programs.&nbsp; This means piccolo
        maintains a hierarchy of visual nodes that can be grouped, oriented and manipulated in
        interesting ways.&nbsp; As such, it is very useful for application developers who wish to
        build custom user interface components and smoothly integrate them with standard
        application code.&nbsp; Most standard 2D UI toolkits provide little support for building
        custom components.&nbsp; There are a number of other structured graphics toolkits
        available.&nbsp; But, many provide a fixed set of shapes that can be added to the canvas,
        making it difficult to define new classes of objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also a number of information visualization toolkits available, such as the
        <a href='http://www.lri.fr/~fekete/InfovisToolkit/'>InfoVis Toolkit</a>, which take a
        different approach.&nbsp; Rather than maintaining a hierarchy of visual nodes, these
        toolkits walk along some application-defined data structure, visualizing each item along
        the way.&nbsp; This approach is simple and it works quite well for visualizing
        information.&nbsp; Since the data is decoupled from the visualization algorithm, it is also
        very easy to plug-in new visualizations.&nbsp; But, this sort of toolkit is not as amenable
        to creating highly customized interaction.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Monlithic Design
      </h3>
      <p>
        Most 3D Graphics toolkits use a polylithic design approach.&nbsp; This means many distinct
        classes are used to represent both visual and non-visual data.&nbsp; Instances of these
        classes are then combined at runtime to create more complex objects.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
        approach is very flexible.&nbsp; And, it promotes abstraction and code reuse.&nbsp; For
        this reason, some 2D graphics toolkits, such as Jazz and
        <a href='http://prefuse.sourceforge.net/'>Prefuse</a>, incorporate aspects of polylithic
        design to varying degrees.&nbsp; But, this approach often results in a proliferation of
        types, which can be very confusing for a programmer to manage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Piccolo takes a more traditional 2D graphics approach, using compile-time inheritance to
        extend functionality.&nbsp; Piccolo defines a large base class that supports all of the
        functionality commonly used by different types of visual nodes.&nbsp; New node types are
        created by extending this base class.&nbsp; We believe this monolithic design approach is
        much easier for the application developer to use.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Multiple Views, Zooming and Panning
      </h3>
      <p>
        Part of the goal of piccolo was to build a toolkit that would enable highly innovative
        visualization and interaction.&nbsp; To that end, Piccolo provides support for multiple
        cameras, arbitrary node transforms and full-screen zooming and panning.&nbsp; This makes it
        very easy to build sophisticated data displays, from fisheye visualizations to Zoomable
        User Interfaces.&nbsp; A number of other toolkits provide support for building innovative
        visualizations.&nbsp; But, few provide the same level of support for multiple views,
        zooming and panning.
