<A NAME="S3"><H1>3. Multiple Representations of Objects</H1>
One of the basic things that Jazz supports is the ability to present
different visual representations of data in different circumstances.
Because many different kinds of context can be used to influence how
and what gets drawn, we sometimes call this <em>context-sensitive rendering</em>.
While an application can use any context whatsoever to control an object's
rendering (such as author or time), two especially common contexts are
magnification and camera.  We sometimes use the more specific term <em>semantic zooming</em>
to refer to objects that change the way they appear based on the current
magnification.  When an object appears differently when viewed with
different camera, we sometimes use the term <em>lens</em> or <em>filter</em>.

<A NAME="S3.1"><H2>3.1. Context-Sensitive Rendering</H2>
The standard visual components that Jazz is packaged with always render themselves
the same way.  That is, a rectangle is always rendered as a rectangle.  However,
an application can define a new visual component whose paint method depends on
various contexts.  The context could include just about anything, ranging
from the time or author, to an underlying data model that this object represents.
<P>
Imagine an application that wants to render a scatter plot.  It could create
a new <tt>ScatterPlot</tt> class that extends <tt>ZVisualComponent</tt> and whose
<tt>paint</tt> method references an underlying data model.  Whenever the data model
changes, the ScatterPlot class would be notified, and would re-render itself based
on the new data.  Similarly, the ScatterPlot class might include in its paint method
the ability to control which points get rendered based on a GUI.  So, this really 
is just a fancy way of saying that an application-defined visual component can
render itself any way that it wants.
<P>
An application might define a Model class to aid in this whose sole purpose is
to generate events when a model has changed to notify the visual component of
the change.
<p>

<b>Basic model-based visual component</b>

<p>
This simple approach is fine except that it couples the different representations
of the data.  This might make perfect sense if there is really is only kind of
representation, but the details change based on some underlying data.  However,
it is also possible that an application wants the opportunity to have
several completely different visual representations of some data.  For instance,
a basic data model might also support a textual table view, or a bar chart view
in addition to a scatter plot view.
<p>
An important design consideration for multiple representations is to implement
each representation separate from the others.  This allows the application builder
to design new representations, and modify old ones without affecting the other
representations.  Thus, it would be nice to design a different class for each
visual representation of the data.  One design that accomplishes this is to
make a special visual component that acts as a <em>delegator</em> for other
visual components, and can switch between them.
<p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ch3-multiple-visual-components.png"><br>
<b>Multiple visual components accessed through a delegator</b>
</CENTER>
<p>
Such a delegator is fairly straightforward to build.  It would maintain a
list of ancillary visual components and exactly one of them would be
active at a time.  It would then define its <tt>paint</tt>, <tt>pick</tt>, 
and <tt>computeBounds</tt> methods to call the active visual component.

<A NAME="S3.2"><H2>3.2. Semantic Zooming</H2>
Alternatively, we may want to use the magnification of a camera to choose 
the representation for the data.
This might make sense if you wanted to show more detail when you zoom in.
<P>
Assuming that you have defined a vector of visual components, the following
code snippet will call a different component to paint every time you zoom in
by a factor of 4.
<PRE>
    public void render(ZRenderContext renderContext) {
	double mag = renderContext.getCompositeMagnification();
	level = (int)(mag / 4);
	try {
	    ZVisualComponent vis = (ZVisualComponent)visualizers.get(level);
	    vis.render(renderContext);
	} catch (Exception e) {
				// Level not loaded
	    Graphics2D g2 = renderContext.getGraphics2D();
	    g2.setColor(Color.red);
	    g2.fill3DRect(0, 0, 100, 100, true);
	    g2.setColor(Color.black);
	    g2.setFont(new Font("Helvetica", Font.PLAIN, 10));
	    g2.drawString("Level not loaded", 5, 50);
	}
    }
</PRE>

Note that this overrides the <tt>render</tt> method of ZVisualComponent
instead of <tt>paint</tt>.  This gives us access to the 
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/util/ZRenderContext.html">ZRenderContext</A></TT>
class which hold various kinds of state that describe the render in progress - 
including the current magnification.

<A NAME="S3.3"><H2>3.3. Internal Cameras (Lenses)</H2>
Some previous systems have used an interface technique sometimes called
<em>lenses</em> or <em>filters</em> to switch between different visual representations.
The idea is that there is an object on the screen that you can drag around,
and when you drag it it looks onto the scene, but some things look different
when seen through these special objects.
<P>
Jazz supports this representation-switching interface simply by putting another
camera in the scenegraph, and setting up the top-level camera to see the
internal camera.  The internal camera then gets rendered as a regular object
that happens to render itself by painting all things that it sees.  The trick is
that by using multiple visual components with a component switcher as we just
described, we can then use the current rendering camera as the context to decide
which visual component to show.  As long as the cameras can be uniquely
identified, this simple approach works fine.

<P>
Let us start by creating an internal camera.

<PRE>
    ZCamera lens = new ZCamera();                 // Create the new internal camera
    lens.setBounds(100, 100, 200, 200);
    lens.setFillColor(Color.red);
    ZVisualLeaf leaf = new ZVisualLeaf(lens);     // Attach it to a leaf node
    ZVisualGroup border = new ZVisualGroup(leaf); // Put a visible border around the camera
    ZRectangle rect = new ZRectangle(100, 100, 200, 200);
    rect.setPenColor(Color.blue);
    rect.setFillColor(null);
    rect.setPenWidth(5.0f);
    border.setFrontVisualComponent(rect);
    ZLayerGroup layer = new ZLayerGroup(border);  // Create a new layer for the internal camera
    canvas.getRoot().addChild(layer);             // Add it to the scenegraph
    canvas.getCamera().addLayer(layer);           // Notify the primary camera to see this lens layer
    lens.addLayer(canvas.getLayer());             // Finally, make this lens look at the primary layer
</PRE>

Then, we'd have to make an event handler that lets you drag this internal camera
around, and changed the viewpoint of the internal camera so that it always looked
directly at the location it was at.

<P>
Then, with a general camera metaphor and a general approach to supporting
multiple representations, we can support an interface for changing
the way things look based on the camera that looks at them.  The following
code snippet will call a different component to paint itself based
on which camera is painting the object.

<PRE>
    public void render(ZRenderContext renderContext) {
        ZCamera camera = renderContext.getRenderingCamera();
                          // Some code to determine which camera is looking at us
	// int id = ...;
	try {
	    ZVisualComponent vis = (ZVisualComponent)visualizers.get(id);
	} catch (Exception e) {
				// We don't recognize this camera, use default vis.
	    ZVisualComponent vis = defaultVis;
	}
	vis.paint(renderContext);
    }
</PRE>
