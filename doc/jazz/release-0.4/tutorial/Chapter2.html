<A NAME="S2"><H1>2. Using Jazz</H1>

<A NAME="S2.1"><H2>2.1. Transforms</H2>
Jazz specifies all transformations of objects and cameras with a
standard 2D affine transformations.  Affine transforms map 2D
coordinate to other 2D coordinates in a manner that preserves
straightness and "parallelness" of lines.  Affine transforms can
represent any combination of translation, scale, rotation, and shear.
In Jazz, affine transforms are implemented with the
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZTransform.html">jazz.scenegraph.ZTransform</A></TT>
class which wraps around the standard Java class
<TT>java.awt.geom.AffineTransform</TT>.  Affine transforms consist of 6 numbers
which are typically represented in a 3x3 matrix where multiplying the
transform T by the vector V results in V'.

<PRE>
         [V'] = [T][V]
     or
         [x']   [m00 m01 m02] [x]   [m00x + m01y + m02] 
         [y'] = [m10 m11 m12] [y] = [m10x + m11y + m12] 
         [1 ]   [  0   0   1] [1]   [1]
</PRE>

The <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZTransform.html">ZTransform</A></TT>
class has many methods for modifying a transform such as
various versions of scale, rotate, and translate.  It is also possible
to specify a <TT><A
HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZTransform.html">ZTransform</A></TT>
with a Java <TT>AffineTransform</TT>, or to get a copy of
the underlying <TT>AffineTransform</TT> that a
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZTransform.html">ZTransform</A></TT> holds.
<P>
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZTransform.html">ZTransform</A></TT>
also has some special methods for more sophisticated
manipulation of the transform.  These are based on the fact that
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZTransform.html">ZTransforms</A></TT>
maintain a pointer to the <TT>ZNode</TT> that uses them.  This allows
the <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZTransform.html">ZTransform</A></TT>
to manipulate itself based on the node.  One method,
<PRE>
        animate(java.awt.geom.AffineTransform tx, int millis)
</PRE>
will smoothly animate the node corresponding to the transform from its
current position to the new one as specified by the transform over the
specified time in milliseconds.  This animation occurs in real-time,
taking into account the system performance.  So, fast systems will
animate the transition with many in-between frames that are near each
other, and slow systems may have fewer in-between frames.  But in all
cases, the total time spent animating the node will be very close the
specification. The method
<PRE>
        position(java.awt.geom.Point2D srcPt, java.awt.geom.Point2D destPt,
	         ZNode refNode, int millis)
</PRE>
will calculate the necessary transform in order to make the
corresponding node appear at a particular position relative to the
specified bounding box.  The source point specifies a point in the
unit square (0, 0) - (1, 1) that represents an anchor point on the
corresponding node to this transform.  The destination point specifies
an anchor point on the reference node.  The position method then
computes the transform that results in transforming this node so that
the source anchor point coincides with the reference anchor
point. This can be useful for layout algorithms as it is
straightforward to position one object relative to another.  For
example, If you have two nodes, A and B, and you call
<PRE>
        Point2D srcPt = new Point2D.Float(1.0f, 0.0f);
        Point2D destPt = new Point2D.Float(0.0f, 0.0f);
        A.position(srcPt, destPt, B, 750);
</PRE>
The result is that A will move so that its upper-right corner is at
the same place as the upper-left corner of B, and the transition will
be smoothly animated over a period of 750 milliseconds.

<A NAME="S2.1.1"><H3>2.1.1. Transforming Visual Elements</H3>
The Jazz scenegraph specifies a hierarchy of objects that exist in the
Jazz global coordinate system.  When objects are created as visual
components within nodes, they exist at their default position in the
world.  For instance, an image is positioned with its top-left corner
at the origin extending to the right and down.  If you want the image
to appear somewhere else, it must be moved (known as transforming) the
object.
<P>
In Jazz, <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZVisualComponent.html">ZVisualComponent</A></TT>
which is used to represent visual
elements, do not have the ability to be transformed. Instead, the
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZNode.html">ZNode</A></TT> to which the
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZVisualComponent.html">ZVisualComponent</A></TT>
is attached has a
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZTransform.html">ZTransform</A></TT>
transform that controls where its visual component
(and children) appear.  Note that the transform is 
stored in the node instead of the visual component because it is
possible for the same visual component to be wrapped by multiple
nodes.  In this way, a single visual component can appear in multiple
places in the world.
<P>
Another reason that transforms are associated with nodes is that nodes
are hierarchical.  In addition to wrapping a visual component, they
are the root of a sub-tree of other nodes and visual components.  When
you transform a node, you are affecting the associated visual
component as well as all of the node's children.  For this reason, we
often think of a node as <I>grouping</I> its children.  Just as in
traditional drawing programs, if you translate a node, then all of its
children will be translated right along with the node as if they all
belong to a single group.
<P>
There are two equally valid ways of thinking about the effects of
transforms.  The first (and typical) way of thinking about transforms
is that the transform changes the place within the global coordinate
system that the affected objects appear at.  For instance, if you have
a node A that wraps an image visual component, and you call
<PRE>
        A.getTransform().translate(50.0f, 0.0f);
</PRE>
The result is that the visual component associated with A, and all of
A's children gets translated 50 units to the right.
<P>
Alternatively, you can think of transforms as representing nested
coordinate systems.  Then, that same call to translate would result in
the A being associated with a new coordinate system that is shifted 50
units to the right of the global coordinate system.  Then, the visual
component associated with A and all of A's children would appear at
their normal places within the new coordinate system, but to find out
where those objects are in global coordinates, you would have to
transform the local coordinate system to global coordinates.

<A NAME="S2.1.2"><H3>2.1.2. Transforming Cameras</H3>
Just as transforms are used to modify visual elements within a
scenegraph, transforms can be used to modify where a camera looks onto
the scenegraph.  The <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZCamera.html">ZCamera</A></TT>
class is a camera looking
onto the scenegraph also has a
<TT><A
HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZCamera.html">ZTransform</A></TT>
(accessible with <TT>ZCamera.getCameraTransform()</TT>) which can be used to translate, scale, and
animate camera changes in exactly the same way that individual objects
are transformed as described previously.  The key thing to keep in
mind here is that transforming internal nodes have the effect of
moving objects within the scenegraph while transforming the camera
doesn't affect the scenegraph, but instead changes how a particular
camera looks onto the world represented by the scenegraph.

<A NAME="S2.2"><H2>2.2. The Damage/Restore Cycle</H2>

An important part of any interactive visual program is deciding
exactly when things actually get rendered (or painted) onto the
screen.  If we didn't have to worry about efficiency, we would just
paint objects onto the screen as soon as we modified them.  However,
in practice this is too inefficient.  Imagine a simple scenario where
you modify the color, pen width, and size of an object.  If we weren't
careful, this simple modification would result in the object getting
painted three times - once after each modification.  A second
complexity is that in Jazz, objects are not assumed to be either
rectangular or opaque.  This means that when you modify an object, in
order to be assured that the scene is painted properly, the system
must repaint all the objects that overlap the bounds of the modified
object.
<P>
Jazz implements a system of region management called <I>damage</I> and
<I>restoration</I> to handle the complexities of keeping the screen up to
date in an efficient manner.  The way it works is that each surface
maintains a representation of what portion of the surface is out of
date.  This area is called the damaged area.  Whenever an object is
modified, the object's <TT>damage()</TT> method is called which notifies each
camera that sees that object to add the area of the object to the 
associated surface's
<I>damaged area</I>.  Then, only when the application requests the surface to
repaint the damaged area by calling the surface's <TT>restore()</TT> method, does
the surface repaint the portion of the screen corresponding to the
damaged area.  The surface then resets its damaged area, and the cycle
begins anew.
<P>
This approach works well, but places some burden on the application
because it must notify the surface when to restore the damaged portion of
the screen.  In practice, this is easier than it may appear because
most graphical applications are event-driven, and all the application
has to do is to make the restore request at the end of every event.
Note that the burden of calling the object's damage method is placed
on Jazz, and not the application.  This is because all of the object
methods that result in modification of the object are implemented with
appropriate calls to <TT>damage()</TT>.
<p>
The default <TT>restore()</TT> method does not result in the component being
repainted immediately, but instead queues a request on the Swing event 
queue to repaint.  Swing is single threaded, and that request won't be 
serviced until after the event listener that triggered the restore in the
first place finishes.  If you want to paint immediately (such as is 
necessary when painting within an animation loop), you must call 
<TT>restore(true)</TT>.
<p>
If you define your own visual components, then you must be sure to call
<TT>damage()</TT> whenever you modify the object.  See the next section for a
description of how to use damage in this case.

<A NAME="S2.3"><H2>2.3. Creating Your Own Components</H2>

As we saw in <A HREF="Chapter1.html#S1.2.1">Section 1.2.1</A>, every
visual element is represented as a 
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZVisualComponent.html">ZVisualComponent</A></TT>
in the scenegraph. At this point, Jazz has
four built-in visual elements:
<UL>
    <LI><B><TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/component/ZRectangle.html">ZRectangle</A></TT></B>
    is used to represent rectangles and squares. Each
    <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/component/ZRectangle.html">ZRectangle</A></TT>
    is defined by a location (x,y) and a width and a height.

    <LI><B><TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/component/ZPolyline.html">ZPolyline</A></TT></B>
    is a displayable set of line segments defined by a set of end
    points. The line segments are drawn between successive end
    points.

    <LI><B><TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/component/ZImage.html">ZImage</A></TT></B> is an image.
    
    <LI><B><TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/component/ZTextField.html">ZTextField</A></TT></B>
    is a graphic object that paints a text string.
</UL>
In order to create additional visual elements,
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZVisualComponent.html">ZVisualComponent</A></TT> is extended. In addition to the general
functionality that is provided by <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZVisualComponent.html">ZVisualComponent</A></TT>, every
visual element is responsible for override the following functions:
<OL>
    <LI><TT>paint(ZRenderContext)</TT> tells Jazz how to render
    the visual element.  Jazz guarantees that the Graphics2D transform,
    clip, and composite are set before the component's paint method
    is called.  However, the component must set the color, font, and stroke
    if they are used.  The component does not have to restore any
    of the Graphics2D state.
    <LI><TT>computeLocalBounds()</TT> tells Jazz how to compute the
    bounds of the visual element. Jazz does not compute local bounds
    every time it needs them, rather it caches the result in
    <TT>localBounds</TT>, and uses a dirty bit to know whether
    the cached copy is out of date.
</OL>
In addition, visual components will frequently decide to override:
<OL>
    <LI><TT>boolean pick(Point2D)</TT>
</OL>
This tells Jazz how to "pick" the visual element.  Picking is used to
determine if the object is under the pointer.  The default implementation
for pick is just to check if the pointer is within the bounds of the component.
If a new visual component's shape is not a filled rectangle that is the
same as the bounds, then a new pick method should probably be defined.
A simple example of this is a circle which should not be pickable outside
of the circle.
<p>
Finally, the visual element is responsible for creating itself and
for supporting manipulation of itself.  We must look at the details of
manipulating an object in some detail.  This is because Jazz
determines when to render an component based on its <em>bounds</em>,
and because components are responsible for indicating to Jazz when they
have changed through the <tt>damage</tt> method, which again uses the bounds.
<p>
Every visual component must maintain a "model", or an internal data
structure that represents the object.  For a circle, this may be as
simple as a center point, radius, and pen color.  For other objects,
the model may be more complex.  Typical components will support
methods that modify itself.  The circle may have methods, for
instance, to modify its pen width or pen color.  It is the responsibility
of these methods to indicate they have changed by calling <tt>damage()</tt>
and by calling <tt>updateBounds()</tt> if their bounds have changed.  All
modification methods fall under two cases, those which modify the component's
bounds, and those that don't:
<ul>
<li>Method <b>doesn't</b> modify component's bounds:<br>
In this case, after the method modifies the internal model to reflect
the change, it must call <tt>damage()</tt>.  Since the bounds of the
component haven't changed, it is enough to simply call <tt>damage()</tt> which
requests that the area representing the component gets redrawn.
The correct sequence of code for this situation is:
<pre>
    // Code that updates model goes here
    damage();
</pre>
For example, see <tt>ZCircle.setPenColor</tt> below.
<p>
<li>Method <b>does</b> modify component's bounds:<br>
This case is slightly more complex because, generally speaking, the
change in the model could result in the bounds growing, shrinking, or moving.
Thus, it is important that the area representing the <em>original</em> bounds
of the component as well as the resulting bounds of the component get damaged.
If we only damaged the area of the resulting bounds, and this method ended up
reducing the size of the bounds, a portion of the screen representing the original
model could be left unchanged.  
The correct sequence of code for this situation is:
<pre>
    // Code that updates model goes here
    damage(true);
</pre>
For example, see <tt>ZCircle.setPenWidth</tt> below.
</ul>

<A NAME="S2.4"><H2>2.4. Adding Your Own Event Handler</H2>

User interaction is a fundamental part of any program and in Jazz this
is no exception. In <A HREF="Chapter1.html#S1.5">Section 1.5</A> we
introduced zooming and panning, the two most fundamental of these
interactions for a ZUI application. At this point, Jazz has four
standard event handlers:
<UL>
    <LI><B><TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/event/ZoomEventHandlerRightButton.html">ZoomEventHandlerRightButton</A></TT></B>
    provides basic zooming of a Jazz camera with the right mouse
    button. The inital mouse press defines the zoom anchor
    point. Moving the mouse to the right zooms in with a speed that is
    proportional to the amount the mouse is moved and moving the mouse
    to the left zooms out. 

    <LI><B><TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/event/ZPanEventHandler.html">ZPanEventHandler</A></TT></B>
    provides basic panning of a Jazz camera with the left mouse
    button. Clicking and dragging the mouse translates the camera so
    that the point on the surface stays under the mouse.

    <LI><B><TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/event/ZNavEventHandlerKeyBoard.html">ZNavEventHandlerKeyBoard</A></TT></B>
    provides event handlers for basic zooming and panning of a Jazz
    camera with the keyboard. While the application can define which
    keys are used for navigation and how much each key moves the camera,
    the default is for PageUp to zoom in 25% and PageDown to zoom out
    25% animated over 250 milliseconds. Auto-repeat is also supported.
    
    <LI><B><TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/event/ZSelectionEventHandler.html">ZSelectionEventHandler</A></TT></B>
    provides basic selection interaction. Visual elements are
    selected/unselected by clicking on them. Shift-click will extend
    the selection and click-and-drag the background to marquee
    select. Once selected, visual elements can be moved by dragging
    them on the screen.
</UL>

Obviously, it will become necessary to provide your own event handlers
for the many things that you will want your application to do. Thus
Jazz provides <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/event/ZEventHandler.html">ZEventHandler</A></TT>
which is an abstract utility class that defines event handlers for
both mouse and keyboard events so that a subclass can override the ones
it wants to define. In addition, it provides a switch functionality
that allows the entire set of handles to be temporarily turned on
(<TT>activate</TT>) or off (<TT>deactivate</TT>).  This type of
functionality is specifically designed for mode-driven
applications. One event handler can be defined for each mode and then
they can be activated or deactivated as needed.  The
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/event/ZEventHandler.html">ZEventHandler</A></TT>
class contains definitions for each of the following:

<PRE>
     mouseMoved           keyPressed        activate
     mousePressed         keyReleased       deactivate
     mouseDragged         keyTyped
     mouseReleased
</PRE>

<A NAME="S2.4.1"><H3>2.4.1 An Example: <TT>squiggleEventHandler</TT></H3>

As an example of a event handler, we provide a
<TT>squiggleEventHandler</TT> which allows for mouse interaction to
draw squiggles on the desktop. A squiggle is drawn on the desktop by
clicking the mouse button and then dragging the mouse. The squiggle
stops when the mouse button is released. Thus, the
<TT>squiggleEventHandler</TT> needs provide the following
functionality:
<UL>
    <LI><TT>mousePressed</TT> event is what starts the act of drawing
    a squiggle. The event handler will grab the position of the mouse
    at the time that the mouse button was pressed, transform it to
    world coordinates and store it. It then needs to create a polyline
    that will be used to store the squiggle and add it to the
    scenegraph.

    <LI><TT>mouseDragged</TT> event gets the next position of the
    mouse, transforms it to world coordinates, and adds it to the

    <LI><TT>mouseReleased</TT> event cleans up.
</UL>
And that's all it needs to do. By extending <TT>EventHandler</TT> we
do not need to be concerned with any other functions besides those
that we need to get the job done. The class
<TT>squiggleEventHandler</TT> has three variables:
<UL>
    <LI><TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/component/ZPolyline.html">ZPolyline</A></TT>
    which holds the squiggle as it is being drawn
    
    <LI><TT>Point2D</TT> which holds the current location of the mouse
    
    <LI><TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZNode.html">ZNode</A></TT>
    which holds the layer in the scenegraph
    to which we are adding the squiggle. This is required so that
    <TT>squiggleEventHandler</TT> so that it can find the world
    coordinates and add squiggles to the scenegraph.

<A NAME="S2.5"><H2>2.5. Jazz and Threads</H2>
Jazz is <b>not</b> thread-safe.  Like Swing, Jazz has been designed from the
start to run <b>only</b> in a single thread (usually the event dispatch thread).
This constrains the way Jazz applications can be built, but we feel that overall,
it increases usability by simplifying code, and eliminating thread-debugging issues.
<p>
An excellent starting point for learning about threads is to read what Sun has
written about Swing and threads.  Almost all of their solutions for multi-threaded
code works for Jazz as well.  Here are links to three major articles.
<a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jfc/tsc/archive/tech_topics_arch/threads/threads.html">
Threads and Swing</a>, 
<a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jfc/tsc/archive/tech_topics_arch/swing_worker/swing_worker.html">
Using a SwingWorker Thread</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jfc/tsc/tech_topics/threads3/threads3.html">
The Last Word in Swing Threads</a>.
<p>
There are a few good reasons where it may be appropriate to run some code in a separate
thread, such as with asynchronous animation.  The following code will zoom in while 
the rest of the application is still active, and responds to events.  It uses the Swing
Timer class which will call an ActionListener at regular intervals.  The trick is that
the listener is always called in the primary Swing event thread.
<pre>
import javax.swing.Timer;
public class AnimTest implements ActionListener {
    Timer timer;
    static final int delay = 50;    // Milliseconds between timer ticks
    ZCamera camera;                 // Caller must specify camera animation should occur within

    public AnimTest(ZCamera aCamera) {
        timer = new Timer(delay, this);
        camera = aCamera;
    }

    // Start the animation
    public void start() {
        zoomTimer.start();
    }

    // Stop the animation
    public void stop() {
        zoomTimer.stop();
    }

    // This gets called whenever the timer ticks
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        camera.getViewTransform().scale(1.1f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
        camera.getSurface().restore();
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
This is a summary of the reasons we chose to build Jazz to run within a single thread:
<ul>
<li>Swing is built this way, and most of their rational applies to Jazz.
<li>It is easier to write and debug Jazz, and to extend it with new components.
<li>It is easier to write applications, and to debug them.
<li>Jazz applications can use Swing's utility functions (such as Timers, 
        invokeLater, and invokeAndWait) to make it easier to use other threads
        to do slow tasks, but synchronize them with Jazz.
<li>Jazz runs faster because there is no synchronization
</ul>
    The primary disadvantage is that Jazz will not be directly speeded up when
    run on machines with multiple processors.
