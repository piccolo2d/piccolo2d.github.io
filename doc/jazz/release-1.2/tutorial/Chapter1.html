<h1><a name="S1">1. Jazz Basics</a></h1>

<p><a name="S1">Jazz is a platform that provides a Java API for
building Zoomable User Interfaces (ZUI). It provides support for
a general-purpose scenegraph with multiple cameras (views). Jazz
provides support for many basic operations, visualizations, and
interactions - but is defined to be completely extensible. Jazz
makes no specific policy about visual or interaction design, but
instead provides overridable default behaviors. </a></p>

<p><a name="S1">Jazz is completely open source. Initially
developed, and currently managed at the University of Maryland's
Human-Computer Interaction Lab, Jazz is already being used
internationally, and is contributed to by people around the
world. Our intention is to support a world-wide community of
users and developers of this toolkit. </a></p>

<p><a name="S1">This tutorial explains the Jazz technology. It
describes how to write Java programs on top of Jazz. It assumes
the reader is familiar with Java, and basic 2D graphics.</a> </p>

<h2><a name="S1.1">1.1 The Coordinate System</a></h2>

<p><a name="S1.1">The Jazz Coordinate System is built on the Java
2D and as such the application's space origin is located in the
upper-left corner of the space, with x values increasing to the
right and y values increasing downward. </a></p>

<p align="center"><a name="S1.1"><img src="ch1-coord-system.png"

<h2><a name="S1.2">1.2. The Scenegraph</a></h2>

<p><a name="S1.2">A scenegraph is a hierarchical data structure
that is used to store the visual elements in the ZUI. Each visual
element consists of two types of objects in the scenegraph: nodes
and visual components. The </a><a
href="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZVisualComponent.html"><tt>ZVisualComponent</tt></a>
is just a visual object that specifies the size of a visual
element and how to render it. It cannot exist by itself in the
scenegraph and, thus, is always associated with a node. The <a
href="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZNode.html"><tt>ZNode</tt></a> is
responsible for maintaining the structure of the scenegraph and
contains all characteristics (position, scale, transparency,
etc.) that are passed on to child nodes. </p>

<p>In addition to visual elements that are represented in the
ZUI, a properly formed scenegraph will also have exactly one root
node (<a href="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZRoot.html"><tt>ZRoot</tt></a>)
and one or more cameras (<a
href="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZCamera.html"><tt>ZCamera</tt></a>).
The root serves as a holder to all of the elements in the virtual
universe that is being represented. The camera serves as a
viewport into a portion of the scenegraph. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="ch1-sample-scenegraph.png"
width="396" height="218"><br>
<b>Run-time object structure in a typical application. This scene
contains a single camera looking onto a layer that contains a
rectangle and a group consisting of two polylines.</b> </p>

<p>The hierarchy of the scenegraph encourages a natural spatial
grouping of visual elements. Internal nodes act to group their
children together passing on their object characteristics. This
spatial grouping allows for efficient implementation of
operations such as proximity detection, collision detection, and
movement. </p>

<h3><a name="S1.2.1">1.2.1. Visual Components</a></h3>

<p><a name="S1.2.1">A visual element is represented by a </a><a
href="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZVisualComponent.html"><tt>ZVisualComponent</tt></a>
object and is associated with a <a
href="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZNode.html"><tt>ZNode</tt></a>. The <a
href="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZVisualComponent.html"><tt>ZVisualComponent</tt></a>
class is the base class for all other visual elements. Jazz
provides several built-in visual elements: </p>

<ul>
    <li><b><tt>ZShape</tt></b> is an abstract class meant to be
        extended by visual components that wrap the standard
        java.awt.Shapes.<ul>
            <li><b><tt>ZPath</tt></b> is a simple ZShape
                implementation that uses a GeneralPath as the
                underlying shape model.</li>
            <li><b><tt>ZArc</tt></b> is a simple ZShape
                implementation that uses a Arc2D as the
                underlying shape model.</li>
            <li><b><tt>ZCubicCurve</tt></b> is a simple ZShape
                implementation that uses a CubicCurve2D as the
                underlying shape model.</li>
            <li><b><tt>ZQuadCurve</tt></b> is a simple ZShape
                implementation that uses a QuadCurve2D as the
                underlying shape model.</li>
            <li><b><tt>ZLine</tt></b> is a simple ZShape
                implementation that uses a Line2D as the
                underlying shape model.</li>
            <li><b><tt>ZRectangle</tt></b> is used to represent
                rectangles and squares. Each <tt>ZRectangle</tt>
                is defined by a location (x,y) and a width and a
                height. </li>
            <li><b><tt>ZRoundedRectangle</tt></b> is a simple
                ZShape implementation that uses a
                RoundedRectangle2D as the underlying shape model.
            </li>
            <li><b><tt>ZPolyline</tt></b> is a set of line
                segments that connects a set of points. </li>
            <li><b><tt>ZPolygon</tt></b> fills in the polygon
                between a set of points. </li>
            <li><b><tt>ZEllipse</tt></b> is a graphic object that
                represents a hard-cornered or rounded ellipse.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b><tt>ZImage</tt></b> is an image. </li>
    <li><b><tt>ZLabel</tt></b> creates a lightweight visual
        component to support a label containing one line of text.
    </li>
    <li><b><tt>ZText</tt></b> is a graphic object that paints a
        text string. </li>
    <li><b><tt>ZCamera</tt></b> represents a view onto a portion
        of the scenegraph. Jazz scenes are only visible through
        cameras, so all applications will have at least one
        camera attached to a top-level window. Jazz supports
        multiple cameras looking onto the same portion of a
        scenegraph. In addition, Jazz supports &quot;internal
        cameras&quot;. These are cameras that are part of the
        scenegraph. They act like other objects in that they can
        be picked and moved around, but are rendered by showing a
        portion of the scenegraph within the camera. </li>
    <li><b><tt>ZSwing</tt></b> wraps a standard Java Swing
        widget. ZSwing provides the capability to embed any
        light-weight Swing widget within the Jazz scenegraph.
        This means that custom 2D graphics can be combined with
        Swing widgets. </li>
</ul>

<p>Visual components are added to the scenegraph by attaching
them to either a <a
href="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZVisualLeaf.html"><tt>ZVisualLeaf</tt></a>,
or a <a href="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZVisualGroup.html"><tt>ZVisualGroup</tt></a>.
These are each node types that accept visual components. <tt>ZVisualLeaf</tt>
is a leaf node and does not have any other children. <tt>ZVisualGroup</tt>
is a group node and maintains a list of child ZNodes. It accepts <em>two</em>
visual components - a front one and a back one. The <tt>ZVisualGroup</tt>
first renders the back visual component, then its children, and
finally its front visual component. </p>

<p>Visual components can be shared in different parts of the
scenegraph. The same visual component can be attached to multiple
nodes. If this happens, then that visual component is rendered
multiple times - once per node that it is attached to. If the
visual component is modified or interacted with, then all
references to that visual component are immediately updated. </p>

<h3><a name="S1.2.2">1.2.2. Nodes</a></h3>

<p><a href="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZNode.html"><tt>ZNode</tt></a>
is the base class for all nodes. Nodes are the basic element that
forms the Jazz scenegraph structure. The <tt>ZNode</tt> class by
itself does very little, but there are subclasses of it, each
providing one bit of special functionality. Applications will
typically chain together several node types to get the
functionality they need. In this way, applications only pay for
the features they need. In addition, Jazz is fundamentally
extensible. If a new feature is needed, an application can create
a new node type, and insert it into the tree. </p>

<h2><a name="S1.3">1.3. Hello World</a></h2>

<p><a name="S1.3">Now, lets create the simplest Jazz application
we can that creates a bit of text on the screen that lets you pan
and zoom. We'll use </a><a
href="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/util/ZCanvas.html"><tt>ZCanvas</tt></a>,
a basic Swing component that creates a minimal scenegraph with a
root, a drawing surface, camera, and a layer. It also adds event
handlers for simple pan and zoom navigation (which can be turned
off). </p>

public class HelloWorld extends JFrame {

    public HelloWorld() {

	    public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e) {
		System.exit(0);
	    }
	});

	setBounds(100, 100, 400, 400);
	setVisible(true);
	ZCanvas canvas = new ZCanvas();
	getContentPane().add(canvas);
	validate();

                                // Add some sample text
        ZText text = new ZText(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
	ZVisualLeaf leaf = new ZVisualLeaf(text);
        canvas.getLayer().addChild(leaf);

</pre>

<p>This program extends JFrame which creates a top-level window.
The two sections of code are standard java code to create a
window. The first bit exits the application if the window is
closed. The second bit sets the bounds of the frame, and makes it
visible, and then makes a Jazz ZCanvas, and adds it to the
window. </p>

<p>Finally, the main Jazz-specific code is the last three lines
of the constructor. This first creates a new text visual
component. Then, it creates a leaf node that renders that text.
Finally, it adds the leaf node to the canvas. Jazz takes care of
repainting the scene when it is modified, and the canvas has
default navigation event handlers, so that's it. </p>

<p>To try out this program, compile and run it according to the
comment in the header. Then, when it comes up and you can see
&quot;Hello World&quot;, click and drag with the left button, and
you can pan the scene (i.e., drag left/right, up/down). If you
click the right button and drag left or right, you can zoom
out/in, respectively. </p>
