<A NAME="S4"><H1>4. Defining Dynamic Objects</H1>

By default, Jazz visual components are static, or still.  That is, they have a persistent
spatial position within the Jazz global coordinate system.  Unless a visual component
is redefined, or the transform of one of its ancestor nodes is modified, it stays
in the same place.  Of course, a camera can change its view so an object may 
to move on the screen, but that is really just changing the viewpoint into the 
scenegraph.  The object has not moved within the scene.

<p>
However, there are many times when an application may want to define objects
that are more dynamic.  Perhaps they should be animated and move on their own,
or should respond to some activity in the system.  An object might
change something about itself based on the current camera view.
For instance, an object might behave normally, but never be allowed to be rendered
below a minimum size.  Or, it might pan normally with other objects, but when the
camera changes magnification, the object wouldn't be magnified with the other
objects, but instead would stay the same size.  This might be useful for a label
on top of an image.  Or, an application might want to define a fisheye view where
objects change their size and position based on the current camera view.

<p>
One obvious approach to creating dynamic objects would be to build the
dynamic behavior into the object.  So, if you want a label that doesn't 
shrink below 4 pixels, then you could define an object whose paint method
would check the current magnification, and render itself bigger when the
overall magnification was smaller.  This approach involves a few details, but
the big problem is that every object must be modified to implement the desired
behavior.  If you want to change behaviors, you must change all your objects!
There is no way to change the behavior at run-time with this approach.

<p>
For completeness, the details involved in implementing a dynamic object this way involve
two primary things.  1) Since the object may be different depending on the camera
viewpoint, the bounds computation must also be changed to reflect this; 2) Since
the object is dynamic, Jazz must be informed of this so it doesn't use some
efficiency mechanisms to pre-compute and cache certain things, such as the object's
position.  This is done by setting the <em>volatile</em> property of the visual
component using
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZVisualComponent.html#setVolatile(boolean)">ZVisualComponent.setVolatile()</A></TT>

<p>
A better approach to defining dynamic objects is to define the dynamic behavior
completely separately from the visual components themselves.  This allows the
behavior to be written independently of specific object types, and allows behaviors
to be dynamically associated with objects.

<p>
Jazz supports a general-purpose mechanism for creating dynamic behavior in a way
that decouples the behavior definition from the object itself.  The approach is
to use a decorator chain.

<A NAME="S4.1"><H2>4.1 The Decorator Chain</H2>
A <em>Decorator</em> is a standard object-oriented Design Pattern, as described
in several popular books (such as Gamma et. al., and now the new Java Design Patterns
seris.)  A decorator is an object that wraps the basic functionality of
another object, possibly adding some new functionality.  In Jazz, a ZNode always
points to a ZVisualComponent.  The visual component represents a visual object
that gets rendered.  Each visual component defines two crucial methods: paint()
and computeLocalBounds(), that define how the component should get painted, and how
big it is, respectively.  

<p>
We can insert a decorator between the node and the component.  The node points
to the decorator and assumes it is the only visual component.  The decorator points
to the original visual component as its child, and typically defines its paint
and bounds methods to call the child paint and bounds methods, and then add some
functionality.  The visual component doesn't know it is being wrapped by a decorator
(unless it checks its parent).  Because there is a little bookkeeping involved in managing the
data structure, Jazz defines a 
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZVisualComponentDecorator.html">ZVisualComponentDecorator</A></TT>
class that is typically extended to define a new decorator.

<p>
Decorators can be used for may kinds of purposes.  Perhaps the simplest decorator
just passes on the paint and bounds method calls to its child untouched, but stores
some other information related to the component.  This doesn't define a dynamic
behavior, but it does store some application-specific object along with the component
in a way that doesn't modify the component.  Jazz uses this approach to define
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/component/ZLinkDecorator.html">ZLinkDecorator</A></TT>
which stores the destination of a spatial hyperlink associated with a particular component.

<p>
Jazz also uses decorators to define some more complex decorators that are dynamic,
and change the underlying component.  A simple one is
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZSelectionDecorator.html">ZSelectionDecorator</A></TT>
which represents a selection rectangle around a visual component.  It expands the bounds of
the object to represent the extra size of the selection handle it draws.  It is also dynamic
because it draws the selection handle with constant width.  This means that as the camera
view is zoomed in and out, the selection handle is always one pixel wide.

<p>
A more interesting use of decorators to create a dynamic object in Jazz is
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/component/ZConstraintDecorator.html">ZConstraintDecorator</A></TT>.
The constraint decorator changes the transform based on the current camera view so that the
child below it gets rendered with a different transform (resulting in arbitrary scaling, translation,
rotation, or shear).  The first uses of this constraint decorator are to make various kinds
of "sticky" objects.

<p>
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/component/ZStickyDecorator.html">ZStickyDecorator</A></TT>
is a decorator that makes objects "sticky" with respect to a camera.  That is, as the camera
changes its viewpoint, and most objects pan and zoom, the sticky objects don't move.  It is 
as if they are stuck to the camera's lens.  The decorator works by applying the inverse of
current camera view transform, effectively removing the camera's view changes from the
rendering pipeline.

<p>
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/component/ZStickyZDecorator.html">ZStickyZDecorator</A></TT>
is a slightly more complicated decorator that makes the child visual component 
pan from side to side normally as the camera view pans,
but when the camera view changes magnification, the sticky Z child doesn't.  This is designed for
for labels which should stay with the relevant portion of the scene they are labelling, but
shouldn't change size since a big or small label doesn't provide any useful function.

<A NAME="S4.2"><H2>4.2 Fisheye Views</H2>
Decorators can even be used to create certain kinds of fisheye views in Jazz.  A fisheye view
is a general term to describe visualization systems that distort the content to show the
focus area in more detail while showing the global context in less detail.  By putting a fisheye
decorator above all the components that you want to be distorted, we can create a fisheye view.

<p>
The following very simple fisheye view decorator changes the magnification of the component
below the decorator so that objects that are closer to the center of the screen are bigger,
and objects that are further from the center of the screen are smaller.  To use this code,
simply create a fisheye decorator for each object that you want to be affected by the fisheye view.
A simple way to try this out is to modify the SquiggleEventHandler in the HiNote demo so
that whenever you create a squiggle, it creates one wrapped by the fisheye decorator.  That is,
in SquiggleEventHandler.mousePressed(), change the polyline creation code to look like this:
<PRE>
	    polyline = new ZPolyline(pt);
	    ZFisheyeDecorator decorator = new ZFisheyeDecorator(getCamera(), polyline);
	    ZNode node = new ZNode(decorator);
</PRE>

Here's the code for the sample fisheye decorator:

<PRE>
import java.awt.geom.*;

import edu.umd.cs.jazz.util.*;
import edu.umd.cs.jazz.scenegraph.*;
import edu.umd.cs.jazz.component.*;

public class ZFisheyeDecorator extends ZConstraintDecorator {
    protected AffineTransform constraintTransform;

    /**
     * Constructs a new fisheye decorator with a specified camera.
     * @param camera The camera the component is related to.
     */
    public ZFisheyeDecorator(ZCamera camera) {
	super(camera);
	constraintTransform = new AffineTransform();
    }
    
    /**
     * Constructs a new fisheye decorator with a specified camera that 
     * decorates the specified child.
     * @param camera The camera the component is related to.
     * @param child The child that should go directly below this decorator.
     */
    public ZFisheyeDecorator(ZCamera camera, ZVisualComponent child) {
	super(camera, child);
	constraintTransform = new AffineTransform();
    }

    /**
     * Computes the fisheye constraint that makes children larger in the 
     * center of the screen as the camera view changes.
     * @return the affine transform the defines the constraint.
     */
    protected AffineTransform computeTransform() {
	constraintTransform.setToIdentity();

	if (camera != null) {
	    Point2D viewCtr = camera.getViewBounds().getCenter2D();
	    float mag = camera.getMagnification();

				// We want to get the child's global bounds, but we 
                                // can't do it directly by calling node.getGlobalBounds() 
                                // because that would result in an infinitely recursive 
                                // call to this.  So, instead, we manually compute it.
	    ZBounds childBounds = child.getLocalBounds();
	    AffineTransform globalFrame = findNode().computeGlobalCoordinateFrame();
	    childBounds.transform(globalFrame);

	    Point2D childCtr = childBounds.getCenter2D();
	    float dist = (float)(viewCtr.distance(childCtr) / mag);
	    float s = 100.0f / dist;
	    constraintTransform.translate(childCtr.getX(), childCtr.getY());
	    constraintTransform.scale(s, s);
	    constraintTransform.translate(- childCtr.getX(), - childCtr.getY());
	}

	return constraintTransform;
    }
