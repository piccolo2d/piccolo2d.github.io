          This section contains an overview of various 2D graphics concepts related to Piccolo.
          This is a huge topic which cannot be covered in depth here. But the basics are presented
          below. In many cases these lower level details are handled for you by Piccolo. But,
          understanding them will help you to use the framework more efficiently, especially when
          extending functionality and creating your own types.

        <a id="Basics"></a>Basics
      </h2>
      <p class="preamble">
        Everything on the screen is graphics.&nbsp; Toolkits, like Java Swing and the .NET Windows
        Forms library provide ready-made standard widgets, like scrollbars and buttons, that you
        can add to your GUI.&nbsp; But, if you want to create a custom component, you have to do
        your own drawing!

      <h3>
        <a id="Drawing"></a>Drawing Abstraction
      </h3>
      <p>
        Every computer graphics system (i.e., operating system) offers some notion of a canvas to
        draw onto.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually, the canvases are separated into windows that are distinct from each other, which
        provide a relative coordinate system and isolation. This abstraction allows the same
        binary-level application to render onto different kinds of surfaces such as screens,
        off-screen buffers (i.e., clipboards), and printers, plotters, and direct neural
        implants...
      </p>
      <p>
        Most current systems offer a a resolution-independent (or device-independent) API. This is
        crucial. If all rendering was done in pixels, a 100 pixel rectangle would be about an inch
        big on most displays, but would be less than 1/10th of an inch big on some printers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Java offers the Graphics/Graphics2D classes that present this abstraction, and C# offers
        the System.Drawing.Graphics class.
      </p>

        <a id="Shapes"></a>Drawing Shapes
      </h3>
      <p>
        Java has a generic <code>Shape</code> class with g2.draw() and g2.fill() methods.&nbsp; See
        java.awt.geom. Including <code>GeneralPath</code> which connects points with lines or
        curves.&nbsp; It can be rendered resolution-independent, or can be flattened with
        <code>FlatteningPathIterator</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        C# has fixed shapes rather than a generic Shape class.&nbsp; See Graphics.DrawEllipse,
        DrawBezier, DrawCurve, etc.&nbsp; C# also has a generic path called Drawing2D.GraphicsPath,
        rendered with Graphics.DrawPath.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a id="Rendering"></a>Rendering Damage/Redraw
      </h3>
      <p>
        In most graphics systems, you override a window's paint method and put all your rendering
        code there, but you don't actually call that method directly.&nbsp; Instead you will
        request a render by telling the OS that a portion of the screen is "damaged."&nbsp; It is
        out of date and needs to be repainted.&nbsp; The OS will collect and merge all the damaged
        regions and at some point later it will call the window's paint method passing it the full
        region that needs to be repainted.
      </p>
      <p>
        In java, you can request that a window be rendered with JComponent.repaint().&nbsp; In C#,
        you would use Control.Invalidate. Or, you could just damage a portion of the canvas with
        repaint(x, y, w, h) in Java or Invalidate(Rectangle) in C#.&nbsp; Remember that these
        methods only request repaints to happen in the future, they do not happen immediately.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a id="Text"></a>Text
      </h3>
      <p>
        Text is a special kind of graphics for both performance and human reasons.&nbsp; Characters
        in any font can be represented either as bitmaps or curves.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some systems, characters are defined as the set of pixels (bitmap) that form each
        character.&nbsp; This approach is efficient since we need the set of pixels that make up
        the characters in order to draw them.&nbsp; But, for large font sizes the space required to
        store all the bitmaps becomes problematic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another approach is to store only the outlines of the characters as closed shapes.&nbsp;
        These character definitions can easily be scaled to any size and converted to bitmaps when
        necessary.&nbsp; Plus, drawing packages can treat characters as geometric shapes that can
        be manipulated like other graphical elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically you will allocate fonts up front, and then use them on demand.&nbsp; See the Font
        classes in Java and C#.&nbsp; Fonts get measured with Ascent, Descent, Height, Leading,
        Width, and Kerning.&nbsp; Higher quality text can be drawn with anti-aliasing or more
        recently, sub-pixel anti-aliasing (e.g., Microsoft Cleartype)
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a id="Color"></a>Color
      </h3>
      <p>
        There are various color models, which are not reflected in the API.&nbsp; Rather the API
        needs to support the color representation of the hardware.&nbsp; There are two basic kinds,
        <em>Indexed Color</em> (8 bit) and <em>True Color</em> (16, 24, 32 bit).
      </p>
      <p>
        Indexed color uses an array of color values as a palette.&nbsp; An index into the color
        table is assigned to each pixel.&nbsp; Using 8 bits per pixel allows only 256 colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Models that can represent a large number of colors are called true color.&nbsp; Examples
        are RGB, HSV, and CMYK.&nbsp; The common 8-bit RGB model assigns a 3 byte value to each
        pixel, one byte per channel (red, green and blue). This model can represent up to
        2<sup>8</sup> &times; 2<sup>8</sup> &times; 2<sup>8</sup> or 16,777,216 colors.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a id="Clipping"></a>Clipping
      </h3>
      <p>
        Clipping, or limiting drawing to a particular area of the screen, is crucial for a window
        manager.&nbsp; Displayed objects need to be clipped to the bounds of the window in which
        they are displayed.&nbsp; But, clipping is also necessary for application efficiency and
        high-end graphics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regions, analytical descriptions of shape, are used for the basis of clipping.&nbsp;
        Regions include algebra for adding/subtracting, manipulating shape and there are various
        types (rectangular, rectilinear, rectilinear with holes).
      </p>
      <p class="image">
        <img alt="Clipping" border="0" src="images/clip.png" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Java has the Area class (made of Shapes) and C# has the Region class.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a id="Efficiency"></a>Efficiency
      </h3>
      <p>
        There are various efficiency considerations that must be made when working with 2D computer
        graphics.&nbsp; Some common mechanisms/considerations include region management (partial
        redraws), high-level descriptions for networked displays, display lists for complex objects
        that are redrawn many times, space-time trade-offs (i.e. pre-allocate thumb image and store
        it, or render it each time).
      </p>
      <h2>
        <a id="Equations"></a>Geometric Equations
      </h2>
      <p class="preamble">
        In a drawing program, there are some common problems such as determining what object a user
        clicked on, finding the nearest object to where the user clicked, or snapping a line to the
        nearest object.&nbsp; It turns out we can use a few simple geometric equations to aid with
        these tasks.&nbsp; And, there are different forms of these equations for different uses.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a id="Implicit"></a>Implicit Forms: F(x, y) = 0
      </h3>
      <p>
        i.e.: Ax + By + c = 0
      </p>
      <p>
        This type of equation defines a half-space.&nbsp; And, intersecting multiple half-spaces
        defines polygons.&nbsp; So, this kind of equation can be used to determining if a point is
        within a region or finding the distance from a line.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a id="Explicit"></a>Explicit Forms: y = F(x)
      </h3>
      <p>
        i.e. y = Mx + B
      </p>
      <p>
        Explicit functions are not good for graphics operations, since they don't plug a point in.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a id="Parametric"></a>Parametric Forms: x = G(t), y = H(t)
      </h3>
      <p>
        i.e.: x = cos(t), y = sin(t) or,
      </p>
      <p>
        x = x<sub>1</sub> + t * (x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>)<br />
         y = y<sub>1</sub> + t * (y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>)
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, both x and y are functions of an independent variable.&nbsp; If you plug in some
        value for t, you can plot a point on the line.&nbsp; The functions x(t) and y(t) vary along
        the line, as t varies so you can interpolate along a line.
      </p>
      <p>
        More generally, this is known in the computer graphics world as LERP (linear
        interpolation):
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>p = p<sub>1</sub> + t * (p<sub>2</sub> - p<sub>1</sub>)</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        The LERP equation bounds t between 0 and 1.&nbsp; It directly supports animation, computing
        intersections, scales to multiple dimensions and can be applied to many domains (points,
        colors, etc.).

      </h2>
      <p class="preamble">
        Often an application will need to translate (move), scale, rotate, or shear it's graphical
        elements.&nbsp; This is necessary for almost any animation and many interactions. One way
        to achieve this would be to modify all of the points in the original object.&nbsp; For
        example, in a game of asteroids, to move the triangular ship down ten units, you could add
        10 to each point in the triangle. The problem with this approach is that it forces you to
        modify your original object.&nbsp; You will no longer have a copy of the original to revert
        back to.&nbsp; And for some transformations, it's worse.&nbsp; What if you scale all the
        points by zero? Then you've lost your data altogether. A better approach would be to save
        your original object and somehow transform it when you render.&nbsp; This is commonly done
        in computer graphics with matrices.

      <h3>
        <a id="Matrix"></a>Matrix Transformations

      <p>
        We can represent some transformations as 2x2 matrices of the following form.
      </p>
      <p class="image">
        <img alt="Matrix" src="images/matrix.png" />
      </p>
      <p>
        We can then multiply the matrix by a column vector to apply the transformation to a point.

      <p>
        Multiplying two matrices of the same size yields another matrix of the same size.&nbsp; So,
        the three transformations above can actually be represented as a single matrix.&nbsp; As
        long as we can represent transformations as 2x2 matrices, we can multiple them together to
        create one representative matrix.

        One common transformation involves scaling around the origin (0, 0).&nbsp; Here, we

        But, we cannot represent translation as a 2x2 matrix!&nbsp; This means we won't be able to
        combine it with rotation and scaling transformations through matrix multiplication.&nbsp;
        The solution is to use homogeneous coordinates.

      <h3>
        <a id="Homogeneous"></a>Homogeneous Coordinates

      <p>
        We add a third coordinate <i>h</i> to every 2D point, where (x, y, h) represents the point
        at location (x/h, y/h). We can now represent translation as a 3x3 matrix of the following

        We can then change our scale and rotation matrices into 3x3 matrices as well.

        This may not seem intuitive or exciting. But, it is quite useful for graphics operations

        To apply a transformation after the current one, we post-multiply the matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
        P&prime; = M<sub>new</sub> &#8729; M<sub>current</sub> P

        To apply a transformation first, we pre-multiply.

      <p>
        P&prime; = M<sub>current</sub> &#8729; M<sub>new</sub> P

        Transforms can manipulate objects or views.&nbsp; If we transform, draw an object, and then
        transform back, we are manipulating objects.&nbsp; But, if we set a transform once at the
        beginning and then draw the whole model we are manipulating the view.&nbsp; Actually, we
        are defining a new coordinate system.
      </p>
      <p>
        It turns out an affine transform actually defines a coordinate system.&nbsp; Imagine we
        apply a rotation, followed by a translation.&nbsp; We can think of this as creating a
        rotated, translated coordinate system, with a new origin.

      <p>
        We can now draw objects as normal using the <i>local</i> coordinates of this new coordinate
        system.&nbsp; So, if we draw an object a (0, 0), it will appear at the new origin of the
        new coordinate system.&nbsp; Thinking of things this way is often simpler than thinking
        about transforming individual objects.

        <a id="Piccolo"></a>What about Piccolo?
      </h2>
      <p>
        For the most part, Piccolo handles doing things efficiently for you.&nbsp; The framework
        implements region management (only repainting the part of the screen that has changed) as
        well as efficient picking (determining which object the mouse is over).&nbsp; Piccolo's
        activities make it very easy to implement interpolated animations.&nbsp; And, in many
        cases, you can use convenience methods to transform nodes rather than interacting directly
        with matrices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Piccolo also has a higher-level model of drawing than the one described above.&nbsp; Rather
        than drawing lots of shapes to the screen in a one large paint method and then worrying
        about repainting and picking them, piccolo uses an object-oriented approach.&nbsp; You
        simply add nodes to the scene-graph.&nbsp; Each node knows how to render and pick
        itself.&nbsp; Instead of invalidating a rectangle and then drawing in the window's paint
        method, you will change the node's model.&nbsp; For example, you may change its fill color
        (paint in Java, Brush in C#).&nbsp; Then the node will handle repainting itself with the
        new color.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each node also has an affine transform that defines a local coordinate system for that
        node.&nbsp; Nodes can be arranged hierarchically, where the local coordinate system of a
        node is product of all the matrices from the root to the given node.&nbsp; So, changing a
        parent node's transform, will affect the child as well.&nbsp; For more details about
        coordinate systems, see <a href="patterns.html#Coordinate_Systems">Piccolo Patterns</a>.
