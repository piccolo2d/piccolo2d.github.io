  * Change event listeners to use active bit ala Jon Meyer's suggestion.

  FEATURES NEEDED
  ---------------

  * 7/1/2000:   BBB - Layout manager should support optionally enable
    layout changes to be animated over time.  I added 
    ZLayoutManager.doLayout(ZGroup node, int millis) so this can
    be added without incompatible changes in the future.

  * 5/28/2000:  BBB - There should be some kind of text label that
    display at a fixed size, but disappear when there is not enough
    space for them.  They should appear at a fixed (or possibly two
    sizes) when there is enough space.  (Requested by Jon Meyer)

  * 1/22/2000:  BBB - Make the editor a bit more sophisticated so that
    it supports user-defined types better, and also multiple instances
    of the same type.  See jazz-chat thread on Multiple Hyperlinks.

  * 10/23/1999: BBB - Add property change events to all components
    so applications can be notified when, for example, rectangle
    coordinates change.

  * 09/15/1999: BBB - Add support for Advanced Imaging API

  * 09/01/1999: BBB - General purpose Animation support, including
    asynchronous animation.

  * 07/15/1999: BBB - Add tutorial chapter describing how to build and install jazz.

  * 05/07/1999: BBB - Design complex composable Lenses
