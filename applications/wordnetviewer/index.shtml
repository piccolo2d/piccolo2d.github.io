      WordNet Java Viewer: A Graphic Browser for WordNet

    <p>
      WordNet Java Viewer is a graphic interactive tool for viewing
      <a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/">WordNet</a> - a semantic network of English
      senses.&nbsp; WordNet is a well recognized linguistic tool, that has been on on-going
      development since 1985, at Princeton university.&nbsp; WordNet is composed of four different
      semantic networks: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Each node in the semantic networks
      is referred to as a 'synset' , that is a synonym set. Synsets usually have a gloss
      (definition) of their meaning, and various links to other sysnets. Such links include 'is-a'
      link (Hypernym/Hyponym in the WordNet jargon), part-of, see-also and others. For a complete
      description of WordNet or for downloading it, check the WordNet web site.
    </p>
    <p>
      WordNet has more than ten different existing browsers (also available at their web
      site),&nbsp; most of them textual. WordNet Java Viewer enables access to the different
      knowledge bits contained in WordNet, as well as a spatial view on the network structure. The
      network is constructed as a graph, using only the is-a links. WordNet Java Viewer uses the
      WordNet c api through JNI&nbsp;code and relies heavily on Jazz classes for the display. In
      constructing the complex graphs, it is only needed to construct the logical representation -
      all the layout is managed by Jazz layout mechanism. Jazz inherent zooming and panning also
      help manage the tens of thousands nodes size networks.

      WordNet Java Viewer was designed and implemented by
      <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~sperer">Ruth Sperer</a>, a graduate student at the university
      of Maryland, under the guidance of Prof. Ben Bederson. For more information about this
      project, please contact <a href="mailto:sperer@cs.umd.edu">sperer@cs.umd.edu</a>.

    button brings up children, &gt;&gt; button shows possible links). The definition can be reached
    by double clicking the desired sense.
