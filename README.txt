See http://code.google.com/p/piccolo2d/issues/detail?id=42

The steps migrating the content from UMD here are

1) cleanup markup (xhtml, css, code snippets) and navigation
2) replace piccolo -> piccolo2d, check links
3) rephrase/rewrite where outdated
4) move .../site/user/* to .../site/
5) get tons of +1 votes on the issue
6) mirror to www.piccolo2d.org
7) feature on the project homepage

P.S.: As the .../svn/site/ has no trunk/branches/tags I version
      the changes with git and push them to .../svn/site.stage/
