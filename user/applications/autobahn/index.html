      AutoBAHN: Automatic Bookmark And History Navigator
    </title>

    <p>
      AutoBAHN is a graphical bookmark/history companion to a traditional web browser that builds a
      navigation history as you browse the web. AutoBAHN provides advanced bookmarking
      functionality by allowing the user to edit, save, and reopen these browsing sessions.
      AutoBAHN is an acronym which derives its name from its functionality -- the Automatic
      Bookmark And History Navigator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of a history navigator is based on an earlier graphical history aid application
      named
      <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/hcil/pad++/papers/hypertext-98-padprints/index.html">PadPrints</a>.
      PadPrints used <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/hcil/pad++/">Pad++</a> as its
      underlying zoomable interface toolkit. AutoBAHN uses
      <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/jazz">Jazz</a>. For its browser/HTML rendering
      technology, AutoBAHN uses a <a href="http://www.icesoft.no/ICEBrowser4Swing/index.html">Swing
      web browser</a> from <a href="http://www.icesoft.no/">ICESoft</a>. AutoBAHN takes advantage
      of Jazz's capabilities to support panning and zooming, and also uses the Jazz tree layout
      manager to take care of managing the history visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
      AutoBAHN was developed by Jin Tong, a graduate student in the Computer Science department at
      the University of Maryland, while visiting the Java Software team at Sun Microsystems.

      The user can zoom in a node on the history tree to preview/review what that page is about.
      This picture shows zooming in a node from a history tree loaded from a previously saved
      session.<br />

      Inactive branches can be collapsed to save screen space. This screen shows the same tree from
      the previous screen with some branches collapsed into one node.<br />
