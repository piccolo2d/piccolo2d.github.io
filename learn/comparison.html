      <h1>Piccolo2D in Comparison</h1>Why should you use Piccolo2D and which version should you
      use? This section will cover the differences between Piccolo2D.Java, Piccolo2D.NET, and
      PocketPiccolo2D.NET.&nbsp; In addition, there will be discussions of the differences between
      Piccolo2D and Jazz&nbsp;(our previous toolkit) and how Piccolo2D relates to other available
      toolkits.
    </div>

    <h2>Piccolo2D.Java, Piccolo2D.NET and PocketPiccolo2D.NET</h2>

    <p>There three versions of Piccolo2D: <em>Piccolo2D.Java</em>, <em>Piccolo2D.NET</em>, and
    <em>PocketPiccolo2D.NET</em>. They contain the same core functionality with a few
    differences.&nbsp; We will examine those differences here.</p>

    <h3>Languages, Libraries and IDEs</h3>

    <p>Piccolo2D.Java is written in 100% java and relies on the <a href=
    'http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/2D/'>Java2D</a> API for graphics rendering.&nbsp;
    Applications built on Piccolo2D.Java will run anywhere java will run (including Windows, Mac OS
    X, Linux and Solaris).&nbsp; The recommended development environment for Piccolo2D.Java is
    <a href='http://www.eclipse.org/'>Eclipse</a>, although it is possible to use Piccolo2D.Java
    without an IDE.</p>

    <p>Piccolo2D.NET, on the other hand, is written in C# and relies on the <a href=
    'http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/gdicpp/GDIPlus/GDIPlus.asp'>GDI+</a>
    API for graphics rendering.&nbsp; It runs on platforms that support the .NET Framework.&nbsp;
    However, currently only Windows machines implement the Common Language Runtime (CLR).&nbsp; So,
    If you really want your application to be cross-platform you should use Piccolo2D.Java.&nbsp;
    On the other hand, the advantage of using Piccolo2D.NET is that it will allow you to easily
    integrate advanced 2D graphics and zooming with standard Windows application code and
    platform-specific features.&nbsp; The recommended development environment for Piccolo2D.NET is
    Visual Studio.NET.</p>

    <p>PocketPiccolo2D.NET is also written in C#.&nbsp; It runs on platforms that support the .NET
    Compact Framework (including Pocket PCs, Pocket PC Phones, Smart Phones, and Windows CE.NET
    devices).&nbsp; There is no equivalent to GDI+ for the Compact Framework.&nbsp; Thus,
    PocketPiccolo2D.NET is limited by the primitive drawing routines available through the Compact
    Framework.&nbsp; See the <a href='#features'>Features</a> section for more details.&nbsp; As
    with Piccolo2D.NET, the recommended development environment for PocketPiccolo2D.NET is Visual
    Studio.NET.</p>

    <p>Below is a chart the summarizes the differences outlined above.</p>

    <table border='1' id='versions' summary='Piccolo2D Versions' width='100%'>
      <tr>
        <th>Piccolo2D Version Differences</th>

      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Speed/Memory</h3>

    <p>In terms of both speed and memory usage, Piccolo2D.Java and Piccolo2D.NET are
    comparable.&nbsp; While earlier versions of .NET had slower image rendering performance than
    Java, we have not done any direct comparisons in several years.&nbsp; In practice, we find Java
    and C# to have similar rendering performance.</p>

    <p>Since performance is critical in a graphics toolkit, we provide framework support for
    plugging in other more powerful renderers.&nbsp; The <a href=
    'http://code.google.com/p/piccolo2d/downloads/list?q=label:Language-CSharp'>current release</a>
    of Piccolo2D.NET includes an implementation of a <a href=
    'http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/default.aspx'>Direct3D</a> renderer package.&nbsp;
    For better performance with Piccolo2D.Java, you can use <a href=
    'http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/agile2d/'>Agile2D</a>, which includes a pluggable <a href=
    'http://www.opengl.org/'>OpenGL</a> implementation of Java2D.</p>

    <p>PocketPiccolo2D.NET is our first alpha release targeting the .NET Compact framework.&nbsp;
    As such, it has not yet been optimized for performance.</p>

    <h3 id='features'>Features</h3>

    <p>Piccolo2D.Java and Piccolo2D.NET support virtually the same feature set.&nbsp; This makes it
    very easy port code from one version to the other. There are however a couple exceptions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Transparency - Piccolo2D.NET does not have built-in support for transparency since .NET
      does not provide a mechanism to set a global alpha composite. You can of course still use
      transparent fills on nodes.</li>

      <li>PStyledText - This is a node used to render styled text data at various magnitudes.&nbsp;
      It is available in Piccolo2D.Java, but not Piccolo2D.NET</li>

      <li>PStyledTextEventHandler - This is an event handler that places a text editor on the
      screen when a user clicks on a PStyledText node, in order to edit the underlying text.&nbsp;
      It is available in Piccolo2D.Java, but not Piccolo2D.NET.</li>

      <li>PLine - This is an implementation of a line node, very similar to PPath, that was
      submitted by a Piccolo2D user.&nbsp; It is available in Piccolo2D.Java, but not
      Piccolo2D.NET.&nbsp; However, if someone ports and submits a Piccolo2D.NET version we will
      include it in the source.</li>

      <li>SWT Package - This is a set of classes to help integrate Piccolo2D code into the Eclipse
      development environment.&nbsp; It is available in Piccolo2D.Java, but not Piccolo2D.NET.</li>

      <li>PFixedWidthStroke - This is stroke class that always has a fixed width on screen, even
      when the canvas view is zoomed.&nbsp; It is available in Piccolo2D.Java, but not
      Piccolo2D.NET since there is no simple way to implement a Pen in .NET.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Piccolo2DDirect3D - This is an implementation of Piccolo2D that uses a Direct3D
      renderer.&nbsp; It available in Piccolo2D.NET, but not Piccolo2D.Java.&nbsp; However, you can
      use <a href='http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/agile2d/'>Agile2D</a> to plug in an OpenGl renderer
      for Piccolo2D.Java.</li>

      <li>Serialization Surrogates - These are several classes that define how to serialize certain
      types, to avoid duplicating serialization code.&nbsp; These are available in Piccolo2D.NET,
      but not Piccolo2D.Java.&nbsp; Piccolo2D.Java uses utility methods to achieve the same
      effect.</li>

      <li>PControl - This is a PNode wrapper for standard controls, allowing you to embed existing
      widgets (i.e. buttons, textboxes, etc.) in the scene-graph.&nbsp; It is available in
      Piccolo2D.NET, but not Piccolo2D.Java</li>

      <li>PControlEventHandler - This is an event handler that implements focused based navigation
      for PControl nodes.&nbsp; It is available in Piccolo2D.NET, but not Piccolo2D.Java</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Just as the .NET Compact Framework is a subset of the .NET Framework, PocketPiccolo2D.NET is
    a subset of Piccolo2D.NET.&nbsp; It has the same core features: hierarchical transformable
    objects, animation, event handling and efficiency mechanisms.&nbsp; But, some features of the
    desktop versions are not available:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>High Quality Rendering - This refers to aliasing and other techniques that improve the
      quality of the rendering.&nbsp; These optimizations are not available in PocketPiccolo2D.NET
      since they are not supported by the Compact Framework.</li>

      <li>Transparency - This is unavailable in PocketPiccolo2D.NET since the Compact Framework
      does not support transparency.</li>

      <li>Rotation - This is unavailable in PocketPiccolo2D.NET since the Compact Framework does
      not support rotation.</li>

      <li>PPath - This is a graphical path node in the desktop versions of Piccolo2D. In
      Piccolo2D.Java, PPath wraps the <a href=
      'http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/awt/geom/GeneralPath.html'>GeneralPath</a>
      object and in Piccolo2D.NET, it wraps the <a href=
      'http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemdrawingdrawing2dgraphicspathclasstopic.asp'>
      GraphicsPath</a> object.&nbsp; Since there is no equivalent class to wrap in the Compact
      Framework, PPath is very limited.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>API</h3>

    <p>The APIs for the various versions of Piccolo2D will all feel similar.&nbsp; In fact, the
    PocketPiccolo2D.NET API is mostly identical to the Piccolo2D.NET API, except that some of the
    classes and methods of the desktop version are unavailable.&nbsp; There are also some
    differences between Piccolo2D.NET and Piccolo2D.Java that reflect an effort to support the
    individual style guidelines and language constructs of Java and C#.</p>

    <p>Method names, for example, begin with a lower-case letter in Piccolo2D.Java and an
    upper-case letter in both Piccolo2D.NET and PocketPiccolo2D.NET.&nbsp; For example, the method
    that animates a node from it's current position and size to a new position and size is
    <code>animateToBounds()</code> in Piccolo2D.Java and <code>AnimateToBounds()</code> in
    Piccolo2D.NET and PocketPiccolo2D.NET.</p>

    <p>Member attributes are also accessed differently in each API.&nbsp; For example, in
    Piccolo2D.Java, attributes are accessed via get/set methods.&nbsp; But, Piccolo2D.NET and
    PocketPiccolo2D.NET take advantage of language supported <a href=
    'http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/csref/html/vclrfUsingProperties.asp'>
    Properties</a>. For example, to access the bounds of a node in each version you would do the
    following:</p>

    <table summary='Code look'>
      <tr>
        <td>//Piccolo2D.Java</td>

        <td>//Piccolo2D.NET and PocketPiccolo2D.NET</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><code>node.getBounds()</code></td>

        <td><code>node.Bounds</code></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The APIs also differ in terms of the underlying types they use.&nbsp; Often the Java and
    .NET names of equivalent classes are different.&nbsp; For example, Java has Paint and Stroke
    classes whereas .NET has Brush and Pen classes.&nbsp; Another example is the affine transform
    type, which is called AffineTransform in java and Matrix in .NET. The names of Piccolo2D
    methods also reflect these differences.&nbsp; For example, the method to animate a node to an
    arbitrary affine transform is <code>animateToTransform()</code> in Piccolo2D.Java and
    <code>AnimateToMatrix()</code> in Piccolo2D.NET and PocketPiccolo2D.NET.</p>

    <p>One very important distinction related to types has to do with how the bounds of a node is
    stored.&nbsp; In Piccolo2D.Java there is a PBounds type which extends <a href=
    'http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/awt/geom/Rectangle2D.Double.html'>Rectangle2D.Double</a>,
    adding several useful methods. But, the corresponding <a href=
    'http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemdrawingrectanglefclasstopic.asp'>
    RectangleF</a> type in .NET cannot be extended.&nbsp; This left us with two choices: create a
    PBounds class that wraps a RectangleF or use the RectangleF directly.&nbsp; We decided it would
    be more straightforward to store the bounds as RectangleF objects.&nbsp; Thus, we provide the
    same methods of Piccolo2D.Java's PBounds as static utility methods in Piccolo2D.NET.</p>

    <p>The versions of piccolo2d differ in the primitive types they use too.&nbsp; Since the Java2D
    API uses doubles, Piccolo2D.Java also stores internal values (e.g. x, y, width, height) as
    doubles.&nbsp; The GDI+ API on the other hand uses floats.&nbsp; So, Piccolo2D.NET stores these
    same values as floats.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Another language difference reflected in Piccolo2D is that Java provides <i>anonymous inner
    classes</i> while C# has <i>delegates</i>. The Piccolo2D.Java API does not enforce the use of
    anonymous inner classes, but, often it is the easiest way to do things.&nbsp; For example,
    using anonymous inner classes, you could create a new type of
    <code>PBasicInputEventHandler</code> in place and override just the <code>mousePressed</code>
    method.&nbsp; In Piccolo2D.NET, you would have to create a named static class that extends
    <code>PBasicInputEventHandler</code> to do the same thing.&nbsp; This could vastly increase the
    amount of code you have to write.&nbsp; So, Piccolo2D.NET provides delegates as a shorthand.
    This allows you to instantiate a <code>PBasicInputEventHandler</code>, and then attach your
    event handler method directly to it's <code>MouseDown</code> delegate.&nbsp; For code examples
    see the <a href='./patterns.html'>Piccolo2D Patterns</a> section.</p>

    <p>Piccolo2D.NET also takes advantage of several other usability enhancements .NET provides,
    including a <i>simpler event model</i>, <i>indexers</i>, the <i>foreach loop</i> and
    <i>type-safe lists</i>.&nbsp; See the <a href='./api.html'>API</a> documentation for more
    details.</p>

    <h2 id='jazz'>Piccolo2D and Jazz</h2>

    <p>Jazz was our previous ZUI toolkit.&nbsp; The following section outlines the major
    differences between Piccolo2D and Jazz.</p>

    <h3>Ease of Use</h3>

    <p>Our goal with Piccolo2D was to create a ZUI that had a similar feature set to Jazz, but that
    was easier to use from a programmers standpoint. Almost all the differences between Piccolo2D
    and Jazz are changes that are meant to make Piccolo2D easier to use.</p>

    <h3>Complexity</h3>

    <p>The Jazz framework design is modeled after a 3D scene graph API. It contains many different
    types of object, each with specific functionality, and these objects are designed to be put
    together at runtime to produce more complicated objects. This gives the framework flexibility,
    but requires many different classes and levels of abstraction to support, making it more
    difficult to use. For example to create a moveable rectangle with Jazz you will need:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>ZRectangle</dt>

      <dd>This is the ZVisualComponent abstraction</dd>

      <dt>ZVisualLeaf</dt>

      <dd>This is a ZNode that is used to place a ZVisualComponent into a scene graph</dd>

      <dt>ZTransformGroup</dt>

      <dd>This is a decorator on the ZVisuallLeaf that gives it the ability to be scaled and
      translated.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Piccolo2D takes a different more traditional 2D approach. There is no separation between
    ZVisualComponents and ZNodes. So the Piccolo2D version of a rectangle extends directly from
    PNode and can be place directly into a scene graph without needing to be wrapped in a
    ZVisualLeaf type object. Piccolo2D has also built many of the most common decorator classes
    used in Jazz directly into the PNode class. For example every PNode has a affine transform,
    supports children, and can have its transparency set. So in Piccolo2D to create a movable
    rectangle all you need is a:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>PPath</dt>

      <dd>This class represents a graphics path and is used to draw all shapes. It extends from
      PNode so it has a transform, may have child nodes added to it and all the rest.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Since the Piccolo2D is a complete rewrite, and a smaller code base we also put a lot of time
    into making the Piccolo2D source code as readable and straightforward as possible. It's our hope
    that this should make it much easier to add your own new features to Piccolo2D then it was to
    do with Jazz.</p>

    <h3>Speed/Memory</h3>

    <p>The speed differences between Piccolo2D and Jazz for most applications are not large, most
    time is still spent painting with Java's Graphics2D. With that said Piccolo2D has made
    significant improvements in the time required to manipulate the scene graph. So if your program
    is moving around larger numbers of nodes at the same time then Piccolo2D should be faster.</p>

    <p>It turns out that for most cases Piccolo2D uses less memory then Jazz. Since instead of
    needing three different objects to support the normal situation of a movable visible object it
    only needs one. This together with better bounds management also makes it much faster to create
    a large number of new objects in Piccolo2D then in Jazz.</p>

    <p>The piccolo.jar size is approximately 65k, while the jazz.jar was about 450k. So for applet
    based applications the Piccolo2D framework will be much faster to download over the web.</p>

    <h3>Features</h3>

    <p>Piccolo2D and Jazz support the same basic feature set. They both have structured graphics,
    and cameras that can look onto that structure using a view transform. So you should be able to
    build anything in Piccolo2D that was possible in Jazz. At the moment their are some specific
    features that we have not ported over to Piccolo2D from Jazz yet:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>ZAnchorGroup</dt>

      <dd>used to specify hyperlinks</dd>

      <dt>ZClipGroup</dt>

      <dd>used to specify a clip group around it children nodes</dd>

      <dt>ZConstraintGroup</dt>

      <dd>used to constrain a transform based on some calculation. See Piccolo2D Patterns for an
      easier way to do this in Piccolo2D.</dd>

      <dt>ZFadeGroup</dt>

      <dd>all piccolo2d nodes support transparency, something that ZFadeGroup was used for. But
      ZFadeGroup also supported automatically changing an objects transparency based on scale that
      it was being viewed at.</dd>

      <dt>Layout managers</dt>

      <dd>Piccolo2D doesn't come with any layout managers, but all PNodes have a method
      layoutChildren() that is easily overridden and will get called for you automatically when the
      size of any of the children changes.</dd>

      <dt>ZSelectionGroup</dt>

      <dd>Used by Jazz's selection management system.</dd>

      <dt>ZSpatialIndex</dt>

      <dd>Used for efficient picking and culling objects that won't be painted. Not having this
      effects speed very little if at all since the vast majority of time is spent painting
      objects, not culling or picking them.</dd>

      <dt>ZSwing</dt>

      <dd>Piccolo2D does not support embedding Swing objects into the PCanvas.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Any needed features should be fairly easy to port to Piccolo2D, please let us know if you
    need something and we will do our best to include it. We will put most of these features in
    piccolox (Piccolo2D extras) so that if we do add them the don't complicate Piccolo2D's core
    classes.</p>

    <p>Jazz has some features that will most likely never be supported by Piccolo2D.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Text file format</dt>

      <dd>Our recommendation is that applications that need a file format should use define their
      own and it will make life much easier for everyone. Piccolo2D does support Java serialization
      for short term persistence.</dd>
    </dl>

    Piccolo2D fits in with the myriad of other available toolkits.</p>

    <h3>Structured Architecture</h3>

    <p>Piccolo2D is a toolkit for building structured 2D graphics programs.&nbsp; This means
    piccolo2d maintains a hierarchy of visual nodes that can be grouped, oriented and manipulated
    in interesting ways.&nbsp; As such, it is very useful for application developers who wish to
    build custom user interface components and smoothly integrate them with standard application
    code.&nbsp; Most standard 2D UI toolkits provide little support for building custom
    components.&nbsp; There are a number of other structured graphics toolkits available.&nbsp;
    But, many provide a fixed set of shapes that can be added to the canvas, making it difficult to
    define new classes of objects.</p>

    <p>There are also a number of information visualization toolkits available, such as the
    <a href='http://www.lri.fr/~fekete/InfovisToolkit/'>InfoVis Toolkit</a>, which take a different
    approach.&nbsp; Rather than maintaining a hierarchy of visual nodes, these toolkits walk along
    some application-defined data structure, visualizing each item along the way.&nbsp; This
    approach is simple and it works quite well for visualizing information.&nbsp; Since the data is
    decoupled from the visualization algorithm, it is also very easy to plug-in new
    visualizations.&nbsp; But, this sort of toolkit is not as amenable to creating highly
    customized interaction.</p>

    <h3>Monlithic Design</h3>

    <p>Most 3D Graphics toolkits use a polylithic design approach.&nbsp; This means many distinct
    classes are used to represent both visual and non-visual data.&nbsp; Instances of these classes
    are then combined at runtime to create more complex objects.&nbsp;&nbsp; This approach is very
    flexible.&nbsp; And, it promotes abstraction and code reuse.&nbsp; For this reason, some 2D
    graphics toolkits, such as Jazz and <a href='http://prefuse.sourceforge.net/'>Prefuse</a>,
    incorporate aspects of polylithic design to varying degrees.&nbsp; But, this approach often
    results in a proliferation of types, which can be very confusing for a programmer to
    manage.</p>

    <p>Piccolo2D takes a more traditional 2D graphics approach, using compile-time inheritance to
    extend functionality.&nbsp; Piccolo2D defines a large base class that supports all of the
    functionality commonly used by different types of visual nodes.&nbsp; New node types are
    created by extending this base class.&nbsp; We believe this monolithic design approach is much
    easier for the application developer to use.</p>

    <h3>Multiple Views, Zooming and Panning</h3>

    <p>Part of the goal of piccolo2d was to build a toolkit that would enable highly innovative
    visualization and interaction.&nbsp; To that end, Piccolo2D provides support for multiple
    cameras, arbitrary node transforms and full-screen zooming and panning.&nbsp; This makes it
    very easy to build sophisticated data displays, from fisheye visualizations to Zoomable User
    Interfaces.&nbsp; A number of other toolkits provide support for building innovative
    visualizations.&nbsp; But, few provide the same level of support for multiple views, zooming
    and panning.</p>
