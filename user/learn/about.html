			<b class="dark_heading">About Piccolo</b><br><br>
			<em>Welcome to Piccolo!</em> A revolutionary way to create robust, 
			full-featured <em>graphical applications</em> in Java and C#, with 
			striking visual effects such as <em>zooming, animation</em> and <em>
			multiple representations</em>.<p>Piccolo is a toolkit that supports 
			the development of 2D structured graphics programs, in general, and 
			Zoomable User Interfaces (ZUIs), in particular. A ZUI is a new kind 
			of interface that presents a huge canvas of information on a 
			traditional computer display by letting the user smoothly zoom in, 
			to get more detailed information, and zoom out for an overview. We 
			use a &quot;scene-graph&quot; model that is common to 3D environments. 
			Basically, this means that Piccolo maintains a hierarchal structure 
			of objects and cameras, allowing the application developer to 
			orient, group and manipulate objects in meaningful ways. <br><br>

			Why use Piccolo? It will allow you to build structured graphical 
			applications without worrying so much about the low level details. 
			The infrastructure provides efficient repainting of the screen, 
			bounds management, event handling and dispatch, picking (determining 
			which visual object the mouse is over), animation, layout, and more. 
			Normally, you would have to write all of this code from scratch. 
			Additionally, if you want to build an application with zooming, 
			that&#8217;s built right into the framework too.<br><br>
			What exactly is it? Piccolo is a layer built on top of a lower 
			level graphics API. There are currently three versions of the 
			toolkit: Piccolo.Java, Piccolo.NET and PocketPiccolo.NET (for the 
			.NET Compact Framework). The java version is built on Java 2 and 
			relies on the Java2D API to do its graphics rendering. The .NET 
			version is built on the .NET Framework and relies on the GDI+ API to 
			do its graphics rendering. This makes it easy for Java and C# 
			programmers, even those targeting PDAs, to build their own animated 
			graphical applications. And best of all, Piccolo is <em>free</em> 
			and <em>open source!</em>

			<p><b class="dark_heading_two">How many versions of Piccolo are 
			there?</b></p>
			<p>There three versions of Piccolo: <i class="dark_text_emph">Piccolo.Java</i>,
			<i class="dark_text_emph">Piccolo.NET</i>, and 
			<i class="dark_text_emph">PocketPiccolo.NET</i>. They contain the same core
			functionality with a few differences. We will examine each separately here. For
			a detailed comparison, see 
			<a class="main_pane" href="comparison.shtml">Piccolo in Comparison</a>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Piccolo.Java</b><p>Piccolo.Java is written in 100% java, 
				and the great thing about Java is that it runs on lots of 
				machines including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Solaris. It is 
				based on the Java2D API.<br></p></li>
				<li><b>Piccolo.NET</b><p>Piccolo.NET is written in 100% C#.&nbsp; 
				It runs on platforms that support the .NET Framework.&nbsp; 
				This means mainly Windows machines. Piccolo.NET 
				provides the same functionality as Piccolo.Java, enabling .NET 
				users to easily integrate advanced 2D graphics and zooming with 
				standard Windows application code.&nbsp; It is a deep port of 
				the&nbsp;&nbsp;Java version.&nbsp; The API is very similar,&nbsp;&nbsp;but there are&nbsp;a 
				few differences to better support .NET style guidelines and 
				constructs.&nbsp; Piccolo.NET is based on the GDI+ API.</p></li>
				<li><b>PocketPiccolo.NET</b><p>PocketPiccolo.NET is also written in 
				C#.&nbsp; It runs on platforms that support the Compact .NET 
				Framework.&nbsp; This means mainly PDAs.&nbsp; Current platforms 
				include Pocket PCs, Pocket PC Phones, Smart Phones, and Windows 
				CE.NET devices.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p><b class="dark_heading_two">What do you mean by &quot;Structured 
			Graphics&quot;?</b></p>
			Piccolo provides support for developers of 2D (+ zooming) 
			object-oriented graphics programs in Java and C#. It uses a &quot;scenegraph&quot; 
			model that is common to 3D environments. Basically, this means that 
			Piccolo keeps a hierarchal structure of objects and cameras. Each 
			node in the hierarchy has a general 2D affine transform which allows 
			every object to be arbitrarily translated, scaled, rotated, and 
			sheared. In addition, the cameras have affine transforms that 
			specify their view into the scene. 
			<p>This simple approach is very powerful because is enables a very 
			decoupled object oriented approach to graphical applications. 
			Piccolo defines several visual components, and applications can 
			readily extend them or define their own. Piccolo supports dynamic 
			and constrained objects that respond to various kinds of context 
			(such as the current camera view). And, the camera model supports 
			multiple views, overviews, and even embedded views (where a camera 
			looks at another camera within the scene).</p>
			<h3><b class="dark_heading_two">What 
			development directions are you following?</b></h3>
			<p>We are continuing to expand and maintain all three versions of 
			Piccolo.&nbsp; But, internally, most of our new research projects 
			are being implemented in Piccolo.NET.</p>
			<h3><b class="dark_heading_two">How do I get a Piccolo License?</b></h3>
			It's free! Piccolo is completely open source. You can download and 
			use Piccolo however you like. The only restriction is that you must 
			follow the guidelines set forth in the
			<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php" class="main_pane">BSD</a> 
			public license.&nbsp; To read more about using the public license, 
			visit the <a href="../download/open-source.shtml" class="main_pane">license</a> page.<p>
			Note that you are not obligated to make your <i>applications</i> 
			open source. You are free to protect your applications in any way 
			you see fit.</p>
			<p><b class="dark_heading_two">How do I contact the Piccolo team and 
			Piccolo users?</b></p>
			<p>There are several ways.&nbsp; You can subscribe to the
			<a href="maillists.shtml" class="main_pane">mailing lists</a> if you would like to ask 
			technical questions or receive announcements about Piccolo.&nbsp; 
			You can also <a href="../contact/index.shtml" class="main_pane">contact us</a> 
			directly if you would prefer to do so.&nbsp; Or, if you find a 
			problem with Piccolo, you can send us a
			<a href="mailto:piccolo-bug@cs.umd.edu" class="main_pane">bug report</a>.</p>
			
			<p><b class="dark_heading_two">Where did Piccolo come from?</b></p>
			<p>Ken Perlin 
			at New York University came up with the initial zoomable surface 
			concept. He and David Fox implemented the first versions of <i class="dark_text_emph">Pad</i> 
			(described in the 1993 SIGGRAPH paper available
			<a class="main_pane" href="publications.shtml">here</a>). 
			Perlin and Fox's original work was supported in part originally by 
			NYNEX, and then NSF. </p>
			<p>The next major step was <i class="dark_text_emph">Pad++</i>, designed by Ben Bederson 
			and Jim Hollan while at Bellcore. 
			They both moved to the University of New Mexico where they developed 
			the bulk of Pad++ in collaboration with Jon Meyer and Ken Perlin at 
			NYU. This was supported largely by a DARPA initiative in HCI. </p>
			<p>Then there was <i class="dark_text_emph">Jazz</i>, a rewrite in Java by Ben Bederson and his 
			team at the University of Maryland. It was a rich toolkit and 
			supported all kinds of features including embedded Swing widgets and 
			SVG. However, it grew too big, and more importantly it had a very 
			general design that actually made it somewhat hard to use  
			because there were so many objects. </p>
			<p><i class="dark_text_emph">Piccolo</i>, the current incarnation, 
			is a direct successor to Jazz. Piccolo takes all that we have 
			learned over the years, and rolls it into a lean and mean tiny 
			engine that is very easy to understand, use and extend. It was built 
			by&nbsp; Jesse Grosjean and then ported to .NET by Aaron Clamage under the 
			direction of Ben Bederson at the University of Maryland.</p>
			
			<p><b class="dark_heading_two">What happened to Jazz?</b></p>
			<p>Jazz has lived a healthy and prosperous life.&nbsp; It has enabled us 
			to perform our research on Zoomable User Interfaces, and it has 
			spawned a new toolkit, Piccolo.&nbsp; Piccolo is now replacing Jazz and 
			now supports everything Jazz does (except embedded Swing widgets 
			which we never found to be crucial anyway).&nbsp; Jazz remains open 
			source, and we will keep it on this website but we are not actively 
			maintaining it, and are instead focusing all of our current efforts 
			on Piccolo.</p>
