<A NAME="S1"><H1>1. Jazz Basics</H1>

Jazz is a platform that provides a Java API for building Zoomable User Interfaces (ZUI).
It provides support for a general-purpose scenegraph with multiple cameras (views).
Jazz provides support for many basic operations, visualizations, and interactions - but
is defined to be completely extensible.  Jazz makes no specific policy about visual or
interaction design, but instead provides overridable default behaviors.

<p>
Jazz is completely open source.  Initially developed, and currently managed
at the University of Maryland's Human-Computer Interaction Lab, Jazz is already
be used internationally, and is contributed to by people around the world.  Our
intention is to support a world-wide community of users and developers of this toolkit.

<p>
This tutorial explains the Jazz technology.  It describes how to write Java
programs on top of Jazz.  It assumes the reader is familiar with Java, and
basic 2D graphics.</a>

<A NAME="S1.1"><H2>1.1 The Coordinate System</H2>

The Jazz Coordinate System is built on the Java 2D and as such the
application's space origin is located in the upper-left corner of the
space, with x values increasing to the right and y values increasing
downward.

<A NAME="S1.2"><H2>1.2. The Scenegraph</H2>

A scenegraph is a hierarchical data structure that is used to store the
visual elements in the ZUI. Each visual element consists of two types
of objects in the scenegraph: nodes and visual components.
The <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZVisualComponent.html">ZVisualComponent</A></TT>
is just a visual object that specifies the size of a visual element
and how to render it. It cannot exist by itself in the scenegraph and,
thus, is always associated with a node.
The <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZNode.html">ZNode</A></TT> is
responsible for maintaining the structure of the scenegraph and
contains all characteristics (position, scale, transparency, etc.)
that are passed on to child nodes.  

<P>
In addition to visual elements that are represented in the ZUI, a properly
formed scenegraph will also have exactly one root node
(<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZRoot.html">ZRoot</A></TT>)
and one or more cameras (<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZCamera.html">ZCamera</A></TT>).
The root serves as  a holder to all of the elements in the virtual universe
that is being represented. The camera
serves as a viewport into a portion of the scenegraph.

<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ch1-sample-scenegraph.png"><br>
<b>Run-time object structure in a typical application.  This scene
contains a single camera looking onto a layer that contains 
a rectangle and a group consisting of two polylines.</b>
</CENTER>

<P>
The hierarchy of the scenegraph encourages a natural spatial grouping
of visual elements. Internal nodes act to group their children
together passing on their object characteristics. This
spatial grouping allows for efficient implementation of operations
such as proximity detection, collision detection, and movement.

<A NAME="S1.2.1"><H3>1.2.1. Visual Components</H3>

A visual element is represented by a
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZVisualComponent.html">ZVisualComponent</A></TT>
object and is associated with a <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZNode.html">ZNode</A></TT>.
The <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZVisualComponent.html">ZVisualComponent</A></TT> 
class is the base class for all other visual elements.
Jazz provides several built-in visual elements:

<UL>
    <LI><B><TT>ZRectangle</TT></B> is used to represent rectangles and
    squares. Each <TT>ZRectangle</TT> is defined by a location (x,y)
    and a width and a height.

    <LI><B><TT>ZPolyline</TT></B> is a set of line segments that 
    connects a set of points.

    <LI><B><TT>ZPolygon</TT></B> fills in the polygon between
    a set of points.

	<LI><b><TT>ZEllipse</TT></b> is a graphic object that represents a hard-cornered
 	or rounded ellipse.

	<LI><b><TT>ZShape</TT></b> is a graphic object that represents a pre-defined java.awt.Shape

    <LI><B><TT>ZImage</TT></B> is an image.

 	<LI><b><TT>ZLabel</TT></b> creates a lightweight visual component to support a label containing
 	one line of text.
     
    <LI><B><TT>ZText</TT></B> is a graphic object that paints a text
    string.

    <LI><B><TT>ZCamera</TT></B> represents a view onto a portion of
    the scenegraph.  Jazz scenes are only visible through cameras,
    so all applications will have at least one camera attached to 
    a top-level window.  Jazz supports multiple cameras looking
    onto the same portion of a scenegraph.  In addition, Jazz supports
    "internal cameras".  These are cameras that are part of the scenegraph.
    They act like other objects in that they can be picked and moved 
    around, but are rendered by showing a portion of the scenegraph 
    within the camera.

    <LI><B><TT>ZSwing</TT></B> wraps a standard Java Swing widget.
    ZSwing provides the capability to embed any light-weight Swing
    widget within the Jazz scenegraph.  This means that custom  
    2D graphics can be combined with Swing widgets.

</UL>

Visual components are added to the scenegraph by attaching them to
either a <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZVisualLeaf.html">ZVisualLeaf</A></TT>,
or a <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZVisualGroup.html">ZVisualGroup</A></TT>.
These are each node types that accept visual components.  <TT>ZVisualLeaf</TT> is a
leaf node and does not have any other children.  <TT>ZVisualGroup</TT> is a group node
and maintains a list of child ZNodes.   It accepts <em>two</em> visual components -
a front one and a back one.  The <TT>ZVisualGroup</TT> first renders the back visual
component, then its children, and finally its front visual component.

<P>
Visual components can be shared in different parts of the scenegraph.  The same visual
component can be attached to multiple nodes.  If this happens, then that visual component
is rendered multiple times - once per node that it is attached to.  If the visual component
is modified or interacted with, then all references to that visual component are immediately
updated.

<A NAME="S1.2.2"><H3>1.2.2. Nodes</H3>

<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZNode.html">ZNode</A></TT> is the 
base class for all nodes.  Nodes are the basic element that forms
the Jazz scenegraph structure.  The <TT>ZNode</TT> class by itself
does very little, but there are subclasses of it, each providing
one bit of special functionality.  Applications will typically chain
together several node types to get the functionality they need.  In this
way, applications only pay for the features they need.  In addition,
Jazz is fundamentally extensible.  If a new feature is needed, an
application can create a new node type, and insert it into the tree.

<A NAME="S1.2.6"><H2>1.3. Hello World</H2>

Now, lets create the simplest Jazz application we can that creates
a bit of text on the screen that lets you pan and zoom. 
We'll use 
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/util/ZCanvas.html">ZCanvas</A></TT>,
a basic Swing component that creates a minimal scenegraph with a root, 
a drawing surface, camera, and a layer.  It also adds event handlers
for simple pan and zoom navigation (which can be turned off).

// Save this into the file 'HelloWorld.java', and compile it with

public class HelloWorld extends JFrame {

    public HelloWorld() {
				// Support exiting application
	addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter() {
	    public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e) {
		System.exit(0);
	    }
	});

				// Set up basic frame
	setBounds(100, 100, 400, 400);
	setVisible(true);
	ZCanvas canvas = new ZCanvas();
	getContentPane().add(canvas);
	validate();

                                // Add some sample text
        ZText text = new ZText(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
	ZVisualLeaf leaf = new ZVisualLeaf(text);
        canvas.getLayer().addChild(leaf);
    }
        
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        HelloWorld app = new HelloWorld();
    }
}
</PRE>

This program extends JFrame which creates a top-level window.  The two sections
of code are standard java code to create a window.  The first bit exits the
application if the window is closed.  The second bit sets the bounds of the frame,
and makes it visible, and then makes a Jazz ZCanvas, and adds it to the window.

<P>
Finally, the main Jazz-specific code is the last three lines of the constructor.
This first creates a new text visual component.  Then, it creates a leaf node
that renders that text.  Finally, it adds the leaf node to the canvas.
Jazz takes care of repainting the scene when it is modified, and the canvas
has default navigation event handlers, so that's it.

<P>
To try out this program, compile and run it according to the comment in the header.
Then, when it comes up and you can see "Hello World", click and drag with the left
button, and you can pan the scene (i.e., drag left/right, up/down).  If you click
the right button and drag left or right, you can zoom out/in, respectively.
