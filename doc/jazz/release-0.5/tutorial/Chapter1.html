<A NAME="S1"><H1>1. Jazz Basics</H1>

Jazz is a Zoomable User Interface (ZUI) API that allows developers to quickly
and easily build ZUI applications in Java 2.

<A NAME="S1.1"><H2>1.1 The Coordinate System</H2>

The Jazz Coordinate System is built on the Java 2D and as such the
application's space origin is located in the upper-left corner of the
space, with x values increasing to the right and y values increasing
downward.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ch1-coord-system.png" ></CENTER>

<A NAME="S1.2"><H2>1.2. The Scenegraph</H2>

A scenegraph is a hierarchial data structure that is used to store the
visual elements in the ZUI. Each visual element consists of two types
of objects in the scenegraph: nodes
(<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZNode.html">ZNode</A></TT>) and
visual components (<TT><A
HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZVisualComponent.html">ZVisualComponent</A></TT>).
The <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZVisualComponent.html">ZVisualComponent</A></TT>
is just a visual object that specifies the size of a visual element
and how to render it. It cannot exist by itself in the scenegraph and,
thus, is associated with a <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZNode.html">ZNode</A></TT>.
The <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZNode.html">ZNode</A></TT> is
responsible for maintaining the structure of the scenegraph and
contains all characteristics (position, scale, transparancy, etc.)
that are passed on to child nodes.  
<P>
In addition to visual elements that are represented in the ZUI, a properly
formed scenegraph will also have exactly one root node
(<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZRootNode.html">ZRootNode</A></TT>)
and one or more cameras (<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZCamera.html">ZCamera</A></TT>).
The <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZRootNode.html">ZRootNode</A></TT>
serves as  a holder to all of the elements in the virtual universe
that is being represented. The <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZCamera.html">ZCamera</A></TT>
serves as a viewport into a portion of the scenegraph.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ch1-sample-scenegraph.png"><br>
<b>Run-time object structure in a typical application.  This scene
contains a single camera looking onto a layer that contains an image,
a rectangle, and a group consisting of two polylines.</b>
</CENTER>
<P>
The hierarchy of the scenegraph encourages a natural spatial grouping
of visual elements. Internal nodes act to group their children
together passing on their object characteristics. This
spatial grouping allows for efficient implementation of operations
such as proximity detection, collision detection, and movement.

<A NAME="S1.2.1"><H3>1.2.1. ZVisualComponent</H3>

A visual element is stored as a
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZVisualComponent.html">ZVisualComponent</A></TT>
object and is associated with a <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZNode.html">ZNode</A></TT>.
The <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZVisualComponent.html">ZVisualComponent</A></TT> 
class is an abstract class on which visual elements are subclassed.
It provides the basic functionality of every visual element. Each
visual element is created by extending the
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZVisualComponent.html">ZVisualComponent</A></TT> 
class. In Jazz, there are four built-in visual elements:
<UL>
    <LI><B><TT>ZRectangle</TT></B> is used to represent rectangles and
    squares. Each <TT>ZRectangle</TT> is defined by a location (x,y)
    and a width and a height.

    <LI><B><TT>ZPolyline</TT></B> is a displayable set of line segments
    defined by a set of end points. The line segments are drawn
    between successive end points.

    <LI><B><TT>ZImage</TT></B> is an image.
    
    <LI><B><TT>ZText</TT></B> is a graphic object that paints a text
    string.
</UL>
In order to add a visual element to the scenegraph, it must be attached
to a <TT>ZNode.</TT> It is important to note that every
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZNode.html">ZNode</A></TT> 
in the graph is assigned a <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZVisualComponent.html">ZVisualComponent</A></TT>.
If identical visual components exist within a graph, then the
component can be shared.

<A NAME="S1.2.2"><H3>1.2.2. ZNode</H3>

The <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZNode.html">ZNode</A></TT> class
contains the basic containment heirarchies. It contains all element
characteristics that are passed on to child nodes including but not
limited to transforms, min/max scales, and transparency. In addition
it maintains a set of 0 or more child nodes.
<P>
A <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZNode.html">ZNode</A></TT> is an
internal node if it has 1 or more children. In this case, the
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZNode.html">ZNode</A></TT> is grouping
together other objects that  share some common characteristic. In this
case, the <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZNode.html">ZNode</A></TT> 
may not actually have a visual component and thus it's visual
component is a "dummy" component (<TT>ZDummyVC</TT>) that does
nothing. This dummy component gives the guarantee that every node has
a component, and thus applications are not forced to check if the
component reference is null before accessing it.
<P>
A <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZNode.html">ZNode</A></TT> is a leaf
node if it has 0 children. In this case, the
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZNode.html">ZNode</A></TT> will
display the visual element of the visual component in it's
<TT>visualComponent</TT> slot. 

<A NAME="S1.2.3"><H3>1.2.3. ZRootNode</H3>

Every scenegraph begins with a
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZRootNode.html">ZRootNode</A></TT>
which serves as a holder of the virtual universe represented in the
ZUI. The <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZRootNode.html">ZRootNode</A></TT>
provides special functionality to a <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZNode.html">ZNode</A></TT>
causing a <TT>OperationNotAllowedException</TT> to be thrown when an
illegal action is requested. 

<A NAME="S1.2.4"><H3>1.2.4. ZCamera</H3>

In addition to the <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZRootNode.html">ZRootNode</A></TT>
and the <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZNode.html">ZNodes</A></TT> of
the graph, the scenegraph also needs to have at least one
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZCamera.html">ZCamera</A></TT> and one
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZSurface.html">ZSurface</A></TT>.
The <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZCamera.html">ZCamera</A></TT> is a
viewport onto a scenegraph node. It can look anywhere onto a
scenegraph scape as specified by an arbitrary affine transformation. A
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZNode.html">ZNode</A></TT> can have
any number of cameras that look onto it. 

<A NAME="S1.2.5"><H3>1.2.5. ZSurface</H3>

Each camera can be associated with a <TT><A
HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZSurface.html">ZSurface</A></TT> that
represents the thing the camera renders onto.  Typically, a surface
will be associated with a Java Component (which is a window).
However, a surface can also represent a printer, and thus rendering to
a window and printer is implemented in the same way.  A <TT><A
HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZSurface.html">ZSurface</A></TT> is
associated with a window or printer by specifying which Graphics2D to
render onto.  In addition, if double buffering is desired, a back
buffer must also be specified.  Most applications that use double
buffering will just use a <TT><A
HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/scenegraph/ZBasicComponent.html">ZBasicComponent</A></TT>
which takes care of 
allocating the back buffer, and passing it to the surface.

<A NAME="S1.2.6"><H3>1.2.6. Basic Utility Classes</H3>

The final piece of any Jazz application is the window on which to
draw the visual elements. Jazz has three utility classes to make it easier
to get an application up and running.  The first,
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/util/ZBasicComponent.html">ZBasicComponent</A></TT>,
is a component that creates a basic scenegraph with a root, surface, camera, and node.
It extends <TT>JComponent</TT> providing an overloaded paintComponent method,
plus a few other
useful things. In this way it appropriately updates the screen based
on a change in what the associated camera sees.
An application is free to use or its own extended component.
<p>
The second,
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/util/ZBasicFrame.html">ZBasicFrame</A></TT>,
creates a top-level window (or frame) with a basic component (and simple scenegraph).  Using this is the
quickest way to get a simple application running.
<p>
The last,
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/util/ZBasicApplet.html">ZBasicApplet</A></TT>,
creates an applet with a basic component (and simple scenegraph).  This can be
used to create a standard Java applet that will run in any web browser with
the Java 2 plugin installed.

<A NAME="S1.3"><H2>1.3. Setting Up Your Scenegraph</H2>

Now we are ready to create a Jazz application. For this example, we
extend JFrame providing us with something visual. There are a few
ordered steps to setting up a scenegraph completely for our Jazz
application.  Here is some sample code that performs these steps.
<OL>
    <LI>Make a container window to hold the window that Jazz will render onto.
    The container must have a size, and be visible (i.e., mapped to the screen)
    <PRE>
    JFrame frame = new JFrame();
    frame.setSize(400, 400);
    frame.setVisible(true);
    </PRE>

    <LI>Declare and initialize the pieces of the scenegraph.
    <PRE>
    ZRootNode root            = new ZRootNode();
    ZCamera camera            = new ZCamera();
    ZSurface surface          = new ZSurface(camera);
    ZBasicComponent component = new ZBasicComponent();
    </PRE>

    <LI>Add the component to the JFrame, set its size, and make it visible.
    <PRE>
    frame.getContentPane().add(component);
    component.setSize(frame.getContentPane().getSize());
    setVisible(true);
    </PRE>

    <LI>Tell the <TT>camera</TT> where to start rendering.
    This is typically done by creating one or more layer nodes, and pointing
    the camera to look at it.
    <PRE>
    ZNode layer = new ZNode();
    root.addChild(layer);
    root.addChild(camera);
    camera.addPaintStartPoint(layer);
    </PRE>

    <LI>Finally, don't forget to paint the scene when all is ready
    <PRE>
    surface.repaint();
    </PRE>
</OL>
This is a lot of steps, and all applications must perform a similar
sequence.  To alleviate this burdon, simply create a
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/util/ZBasicComponent.html">ZBasicComponent</A></TT>,
which does them for you.
From the component, an application can access the elements.
Thus the setup of the scenegraph is complete, but there are no visual
elements in it.

<A NAME="S1.4"><H2>1.4. Adding Nodes</H2>

There are three steps to adding a visual element to your scenegraph:
<OL>
    <LI>Create the visual component.
    <PRE>
    ZText text = new ZText("Hello World!");
    </PRE>
    <LI>Create a node with the visual component and translate it so
    that it will be visible on the screen.
    <PRE>
    ZNode node = new ZNode(text);
    node.getTransform().translate(150, 150);    
    </PRE>
    <LI>Add the node to it's parent in the scenegraph.
    <PRE>
    layer.addChild(node);
    </PRE>
</OL>

<A NAME="S1.5"><H2>1.5. Adding Zooming and Panning</H2>

For any ZUI application to be complete, it must support two
fundamental interactions: zooming and panning. Jazz supplies various
event handling that support navigation. An application could use any
of these or create its own. For now, we will use these two event
handlers:
<UL>
    <LI><B><TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/event/ZoomEventHandlerRightButton.html">ZoomEventHandlerRightButton</A></TT></B>
    provides basic zooming of a Jazz surface with the right mouse
    button. The inital mouse press defines the zoom anchor
    point. Moving the mouse to the right zooms in with a speed that is
    proportional to the amount the mouse is moved and moving the mouse
    to the left zooms out. 

    <LI><B><TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/event/ZPanEventHandler.html">ZPanEventHandler</A></TT></B>
    provides basic panning of a Jazz surface with the left mouse
    button. Clicking and dragging the mouse translates the camera associated
    with the surface so that the point on the surface stays under the mouse.
</UL>
To add a Jazz event handler to an application, it simply needs to be
declared and activated:
<PRE>
    ZEventHandler zoomHandler;
    zoomHandler = new ZoomEventHandlerRightButton(component, surface);
    zoomHandler.activate();
</PRE>

<A NAME="S1.6"><H2>1.6. Sample Application</H2>
The following is a sample "Hello World" Jazz application which
creates a very simple scenegraph, displays it on the screen, and
allows the user to zoom and pan.

<A NAME="S1.7"><H2>1.7. Simplest "Hello World" Application</H2>
Because this kind of application is so common, Jazz defines a simple class called
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/util/ZBasicframe.html">ZBasicFrame</A></TT>.
ZBasicFrame does everything in the previous example except for actually creating the "Hello World" text,
so that is all that is left for us to do.  So, actually, the simplest
Jazz "Hello World" application looks like this:
<PRE>
// Assuming this class is defined in the default package, save it into
// the file 'SimplestPad.java', and compile it with
//
//      javac SimplestPad.java
//
// and run it with
//
//      java SimplestPad
//
// Be sure to set your CLASSPATH environment variable to include the
// directory that Jazz is installed in

import edu.umd.cs.jazz.util.*;
import edu.umd.cs.jazz.component.*;
import edu.umd.cs.jazz.scenegraph.*;

public class SimplestPad extends ZBasicFrame {

    public SimplestPad() {
                                // Add some sample text
        ZText text = new ZText("Hello World!");
        ZNode node = new ZNode(text);
        node.getTransform().translate(100, 100);
        getLayer().addChild(node);

        getSurface().restore();
    }
        
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        SimplestPad app = new SimplestPad();
    }
}
</PRE>
By default, ZBasicFrame create a Jazz window in a simple Swing frame.
However, if the constructor is called with the desktopRequested flag set to true,
then it will create the Jazz window in an internal frame within a Swing desktop:
