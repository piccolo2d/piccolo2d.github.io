                 Why should you use Piccolo and which version should you use? This section will
                cover the differences between Piccolo.Java, Piccolo.NET, and
                PocketPiccolo.NET.&#160; In addition, there will be discussions of the differences
                between Piccolo and Jazz&#160;(our previous toolkit) and how Piccolo relates to
                other available toolkits.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Piccolo.Java is written in 100% java and relies on the <a class="main_pane"
                  href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/2D/">Java2D</a> API for graphics
                  rendering.&#160; Applications built on Piccolo.Java will run anywhere java will
                  run (including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Solaris).&#160; The recommended
                  development environment for Piccolo.Java is <a class="main_pane"
                  href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>, although it is possible to use
                  Piccolo.Java without an IDE.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Piccolo.NET, on the other hand, is written in C# and relies on the
                  <a class="main_pane"
                  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/gdicpp/GDIPlus/GDIPlus.asp">
                  GDI+</a> API for graphics rendering.&#160; It runs on platforms that support the
                  .NET Framework.&#160; However, currently only Windows machines implement the
                  Common Language Runtime (CLR).&#160; So, If you really want your application to
                  be cross-platform you should use Piccolo.Java.&#160; On the other hand, the
                  advantage of using Piccolo.NET is that it will allow you to easily integrate
                  advanced 2D graphics and zooming with standard Windows application code and
                  platform-specific features.&#160; The recommended development environment for
                  Piccolo.NET is Visual Studio.NET.
                </p>
                <p>
                  PocketPiccolo.NET is also written in C#.&#160; It runs on platforms that support
                  the .NET Compact Framework (including Pocket PCs, Pocket PC Phones, Smart Phones,
                  and Windows CE.NET devices).&#160; There is no equivalent to GDI+ for the Compact
                  Framework.&#160; Thus, PocketPiccolo.NET is limited by the primitive drawing
                  routines available through the Compact Framework.&#160; See the
                  <a class="main_pane" href="#features">Features</a> section for more
                  details.&#160; As with Piccolo.NET, the recommended development environment for
                  PocketPiccolo.NET is Visual Studio.NET.

                <p>
                  In terms of both speed and memory usage, Piccolo.Java and Piccolo.NET are
                  comparable.&#160; While earlier versions of .NET had slower image rendering
                  performance than Java, we have not done any direct comparisons in several
                  years.&#160; In practice, we find Java and C# to have similar rendering
                  performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since performance is critical in a graphics toolkit, we provide framework support
                  for plugging in other more powerful renderers.&#160; The <a class="main_pane"
                  href="../download/index.shtml#Source">current release</a> of Piccolo.NET includes
                  an implementation of a <a class="main_pane"
                  href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/directx/default.aspx">Direct3D</a>
                  renderer package.&#160; For better performance with Piccolo.Java, you can use
                  <a class="main_pane" href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/agile2d/">Agile2D</a>,
                  which includes a pluggable <a class="main_pane"
                  href="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> implementation of Java2D.
                </p>
                <p>
                  PocketPiccolo.NET is our first alpha release targeting the .NET Compact
                  framework.&#160; As such, it has not yet been optimized for performance.

                <p>
                  Piccolo.Java and Piccolo.NET support virtually the same feature set.&#160; This
                  makes it very easy port code from one version to the other. There are however a
                  couple exceptions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Transparency - Piccolo.NET does not have built-in support for transparency
                    since .NET does not provide a mechanism to set a global alpha composite. You
                    can of course still use transparent fills on nodes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    PStyledText - This is a node used to render styled text data at various
                    magnitudes.&#160; It is available in Piccolo.Java, but not Piccolo.NET
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    PStyledTextEventHandler - This is an event handler that places a text editor on
                    the screen when a user clicks on a PStyledText node, in order to edit the
                    underlying text.&#160; It is available in Piccolo.Java, but not Piccolo.NET.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    PLine - This is an implementation of a line node, very similar to PPath, that
                    was submitted by a Piccolo user.&#160; It is available in Piccolo.Java, but not
                    Piccolo.NET.&#160; However, if someone ports and submits a Piccolo.NET version
                    we will include it in the source.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    SWT Package - This is a set of classes to help integrate Piccolo code into the
                    Eclipse development environment.&#160; It is available in Piccolo.Java, but not
                    Piccolo.NET.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    PFixedWidthStroke - This is stroke class that always has a fixed width on
                    screen, even when the canvas view is zoomed.&#160; It is available in
                    Piccolo.Java, but not Piccolo.NET since there is no simple way to implement a
                    Pen in .NET.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    PiccoloDirect3D - This is an implementation of Piccolo that uses a Direct3D
                    renderer.&#160; It available in Piccolo.NET, but not Piccolo.Java.&#160;
                    However, you can use <a class="main_pane"
                    href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/agile2d/">Agile2D</a> to plug in an OpenGl
                    renderer for Piccolo.Java.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Serialization Surrogates - These are several classes that define how to
                    serialize certain types, to avoid duplicating serialization code.&#160; These
                    are available in Piccolo.NET, but not Piccolo.Java.&#160; Piccolo.Java uses
                    utility methods to achieve the same effect.

                  <li>
                    PControl - This is a PNode wrapper for standard controls, allowing you to embed
                    existing widgets (i.e. buttons, textboxes, etc.) in the scene-graph.&#160; It
                    is available in Piccolo.NET, but not Piccolo.Java

                  <li>
                    PControlEventHandler - This is an event handler that implements focused based
                    navigation for PControl nodes.&#160; It is available in Piccolo.NET, but not
                    Piccolo.Java

                  Just as the .NET Compact Framework is a subset of the .NET Framework,
                  PocketPiccolo.NET is a subset of Piccolo.NET.&#160; It has the same core
                  features: hierarchical transformable objects, animation, event handling and
                  efficiency mechanisms.&#160; But, some features of the desktop versions are not
                  available:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    High Quality Rendering - This refers to aliasing and other techniques that
                    improve the quality of the rendering.&#160; These optimizations are not
                    available in PocketPiccolo.NET since they are not supported by the Compact
                    Framework.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Transparency - This is unavailable in PocketPiccolo.NET since the Compact
                    Framework does not support transparency.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Rotation - This is unavailable in PocketPiccolo.NET since the Compact Framework
                    does not support rotation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    PPath - This is a graphical path node in the desktop versions of Piccolo. In
                    Piccolo.Java, PPath wraps the <a class="main_pane"
                    href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/awt/geom/GeneralPath.html">GeneralPath</a>
                    object and in Piccolo.NET, it wraps the <a class="main_pane"

                    GraphicsPath</a> object.&#160; Since there is no equivalent class to wrap in
                    the Compact Framework, PPath is very limited.

                </ul>
                <p>
                  <b>API</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The APIs for the various versions of Piccolo will all feel similar.&#160; In
                  fact, the PocketPiccolo.NET API is mostly identical to the Piccolo.NET API,
                  except that some of the classes and methods of the desktop version are
                  unavailable.&#160; There are also some differences between Piccolo.NET and
                  Piccolo.Java that reflect an effort to support the individual style guidelines
                  and language constructs of Java and C#.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Method names, for example, begin with a lower-case letter in Piccolo.Java and an
                  upper-case letter in both Piccolo.NET and PocketPiccolo.NET.&#160; For example,
                  the method that animates a node from it's current position and size to a new
                  position and size is <code>animateToBounds()</code> in Piccolo.Java and
                  <code>AnimateToBounds()</code> in Piccolo.NET and PocketPiccolo.NET.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Member attributes are also accessed differently in each API.&#160; For example,
                  in Piccolo.Java, attributes are accessed via get/set methods.&#160; But,
                  Piccolo.NET and PocketPiccolo.NET take advantage of language supported
                  <a class="main_pane"
                  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/csref/html/vclrfUsingProperties.asp">
                  Properties</a>. For example, to access the bounds of a node in each version you
                  would do the following:
                </p>
                <table border="0" width="500" id="table2">
                  <tr>
                    <td>
                      &#160;
                    </td>
                    <td>
                      //Piccolo.Java
                    </td>
                    <td>
                      //Piccolo.NET and PocketPiccolo.NET
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td width="5">
                      &#160;
                    </td>
                    <td>
                      <code>node.getBounds()</code>
                    </td>
                    <td>
                      <code>node.Bounds</code>
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                </table>
                <p>
                  The APIs also differ in terms of the underlying types they use.&#160; Often the
                  Java and .NET names of equivalent classes are different.&#160; For example, Java
                  has Paint and Stroke classes whereas .NET has Brush and Pen classes.&#160;
                  Another example is the affine transform type, which is called AffineTransform in
                  java and Matrix in .NET. The names of Piccolo methods also reflect these
                  differences.&#160; For example, the method to animate a node to an arbitrary
                  affine transform is <code>animateToTransform()</code> in Piccolo.Java and
                  <code>AnimateToMatrix()</code> in Piccolo.NET and PocketPiccolo.NET.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One very important distinction related to types has to do with how the bounds of
                  a node is stored.&#160; In Piccolo.Java there is a PBounds type which extends
                  <a class="main_pane"
                  href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/awt/geom/Rectangle2D.Double.html">
                  Rectangle2D.Double</a>, adding several useful methods. But, the corresponding
                  <a class="main_pane"
                  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemdrawingrectanglefclasstopic.asp">
                  RectangleF</a> type in .NET cannot be extended.&#160; This left us with two
                  choices: create a PBounds class that wraps a RectangleF or use the RectangleF
                  directly.&#160; We decided it would be more straightforward to store the bounds
                  as RectangleF objects.&#160; Thus, we provide the same methods of Piccolo.Java's
                  PBounds as static utility methods in Piccolo.NET.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The versions of piccolo differ in the primitive types they use too.&#160; Since
                  the Java2D API uses doubles, Piccolo.Java also stores internal values (e.g. x, y,
                  width, height) as doubles.&#160; The GDI+ API on the other hand uses
                  floats.&#160; So, Piccolo.NET stores these same values as floats.&#160;
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another language difference reflected in Piccolo is that Java provides
                  <i>anonymous inner classes</i> while C# has <i>delegates</i>. The Piccolo.Java
                  API does not enforce the use of anonymous inner classes, but, often it is the
                  easiest way to do things.&#160; For example, using anonymous inner classes, you
                  could create a new type of <code>PBasicInputEventHandler</code> in place and
                  override just the <code>mousePressed</code> method.&#160; In Piccolo.NET, you
                  would have to create a named static class that extends
                  <code>PBasicInputEventHandler</code> to do the same thing.&#160; This could
                  vastly increase the amount of code you have to write.&#160; So, Piccolo.NET
                  provides delegates as a shorthand. This allows you to instantiate a
                  <code>PBasicInputEventHandler</code>, and then attach your event handler method
                  directly to it's <code>MouseDown</code> delegate.&#160; For code examples see the
                  <a class="main_pane" href="patterns.shtml">Piccolo Patterns</a> section.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Piccolo.NET also takes advantage of several other usability enhancements .NET
                  provides, including a <i>simpler event model</i>, <i>indexers</i>, the <i>foreach
                  loop</i> and <i>type-safe lists</i>.&#160; See the <a class="main_pane"
                  href="api.shtml">API</a> documentation for more details.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Jazz was our previous ZUI toolkit.&#160; The following section outlines the major
                  differences between Piccolo and Jazz.
                </p><b>Ease of Use</b> 
                <p>
                  Our goal with Piccolo was to create a ZUI that had a similar feature set to Jazz,
                  but that was easier to use from a programmers standpoint. Almost all the
                  differences between Piccolo and Jazz are changes that are meant to make Piccolo
                  easier to use.
                </p><b>Complexity</b> 
                <p>
                  The Jazz framework design is modeled after a 3D scene graph API. It contains many
                  different types of object, each with specific functionality, and these objects
                  are designed to be put together at runtime to produce more complicated objects.
                  This gives the framework flexibility, but requires many different classes and
                  levels of abstraction to support, making it more difficult to use. For example to
                  create a moveable rectangle with Jazz you will need:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    ZRectangle - This is the ZVisualComponent abstraction
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ZVisualLeaf - This is a ZNode that is used to place a ZVisualComponent into a
                    scene graph
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ZTransformGroup - This is a decorator on the ZVisuallLeaf that gives it the
                    ability to be scaled and translated.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Piccolo takes a different more traditional 2D approach. There is no separation
                  between ZVisualComponents and ZNodes. So the Piccolo version of a rectangle
                  extends directly from PNode and can be place directly into a scene graph without
                  needing to be wrapped in a ZVisualLeaf type object. Piccolo has also built many
                  of the most common decorator classes used in Jazz directly into the PNode class.
                  For example every PNode has a affine transform, supports children, and can have
                  its transparency set. So in Piccolo to create a movable rectangle all you need is
                  a:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    PPath - This class represents a graphics path and is used to draw all shapes.
                    It extends from PNode so it has a transform, may have child nodes added to it
                    and all the rest.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Since the Piccolo is a complete rewrite, and a smaller code base we also put a
                  lot of time into making the Piccolo source code as readable and strait forward as
                  possible. It's our hope that this should make it much easier to add your own new
                  features to Piccolo then it was to do with Jazz.
                </p><b>Speed/Memory</b> 
                <p>
                  The speed differences between Piccolo and Jazz for most applications are not
                  large, most time is still spent painting with Java's Graphics2D. With that said
                  Piccolo has made significant improvements in the time required to manipulate the
                  scene graph. So if your program is moving around larger numbers of nodes at the
                  same time then Piccolo should be faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It turns out that for most cases Piccolo uses less memory then Jazz. Since
                  instead of needing three different objects to support the normal situation of a
                  movable visible object it only needs one. This together with better bounds
                  management also makes it much faster to create a large number of new objects in
                  Piccolo then in Jazz.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The piccolo.jar size is approximately 65k, while the jazz.jar was about 450k. So
                  for applet based applications the Piccolo framework will be much faster to
                  download over the web.
                </p><b>Features</b> 
                <p>
                  Piccolo and Jazz support the same basic feature set. They both have structured
                  graphics, and cameras that can look onto that structure using a view transform.
                  So you should be able to build anything in Piccolo that was possible in Jazz. At
                  the moment their are some specific features that we have not ported over to
                  Piccolo from Jazz yet:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    ZAnchorGroup - used to specify hyperlinks
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ZClipGroup - used to specify a clip group around it children nodes
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ZConstraintGroup - used to constrain a transform based on some calculation. See
                    Piccolo Patterns for an easier way to do this in Piccolo.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ZFadeGroup - all piccolo nodes support transparency, something that ZFadeGroup
                    was used for. But ZFadeGroup also supported automatically changing an objects
                    transparency based on scale that it was being viewed at.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Layout managers - Piccolo doesn't come with any layout managers, but all PNodes
                    have a method layoutChildren() that is easily overridden and will get called
                    for you automatically when the size of any of the children changes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ZSelectionGroup - Used by Jazz's selection management system.&#160;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ZSpatialIndex - Used for efficient picking and culling objects that won't be
                    painted. Not having this effects speed very little if at all since the vast
                    majority of time is spent painting objects, not culling or picking them.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    ZSwing - Piccolo does not support embedding Swing objects into the PCanvas.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Any needed features should be fairly easy to port to Piccolo, please let us know
                  if you need something and well do our best to include it. We will put most of
                  these features in piccolox (Piccolo extras) so that if we do add them the don't
                  complicate Piccolo's core classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jazz has some features that will most likely never be supported by Piccolo
                </p>

                    Text file format. Our recommendation is that applications that need a file
                    format should use define their own and it will make life much easier for
                    everyone. Piccolo does support Java serialization for short term persistence.

                  There are numerous graphical toolkits available.&#160; This section will explain
                  how Piccolo fits in with the myriad of other available toolkits.

                  <b>Structured Architecture</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Piccolo is a toolkit for building structured 2D graphics programs.&#160; This
                  means piccolo maintains a hierarchy of visual nodes that can be grouped, oriented
                  and manipulated in interesting ways.&#160; As such, it is very useful for
                  application developers who wish to build custom user interface components and
                  smoothly integrate them with standard application code.&#160; Most standard 2D UI
                  toolkits provide little support for building custom components.&#160; There are a
                  number of other structured graphics toolkits available.&#160; But, many provide a
                  fixed set of shapes that can be added to the canvas, making it difficult to
                  define new classes of objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are also a number of information visualization toolkits available, such as
                  the <a class="main_pane" href="http://www.lri.fr/~fekete/InfovisToolkit/">InfoVis
                  Toolkit</a>, which take a different approach.&#160; Rather than maintaining a
                  hierarchy of visual nodes, these toolkits walk along some application-defined
                  data structure, visualizing each item along the way.&#160; This approach is
                  simple and it works quite well for visualizing information.&#160; Since the data
                  is decoupled from the visualization algorithm, it is also very easy to plug-in
                  new visualizations.&#160; But, this sort of toolkit is not as amenable to
                  creating highly customized interaction.

                  <b>Monlithic Design</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most 3D Graphics toolkits use a polylithic design approach.&#160; This means many
                  distinct classes are used to represent both visual and non-visual data.&#160;
                  Instances of these classes are then combined at runtime to create more complex
                  objects.&#160;&#160; This approach is very flexible.&#160; And, it promotes
                  abstraction and code reuse.&#160; For this reason, some 2D graphics toolkits,
                  such as Jazz and <a class="main_pane"
                  href="http://prefuse.sourceforge.net/">Prefuse</a>, incorporate aspects of
                  polylithic design to varying degrees.&#160; But, this approach often results in a
                  proliferation of types, which can be very confusing for a programmer to manage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Piccolo takes a more traditional 2D graphics approach, using compile-time
                  inheritance to extend functionality.&#160; Piccolo defines a large base class
                  that supports all of the functionality commonly used by different types of visual
                  nodes.&#160; New node types are created by extending this base class.&#160; We
                  believe this monolithic design approach is much easier for the application
                  developer to use.

                  <b>Multiple Views, Zooming and Panning</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Part of the goal of piccolo was to build a toolkit that would enable highly
                  innovative visualization and interaction.&#160; To that end, Piccolo provides
                  support for multiple cameras, arbitrary node transforms and full-screen zooming
                  and panning.&#160; This makes it very easy to build sophisticated data displays,
                  from fisheye visualizations to Zoomable User Interfaces.&#160; A number of other
                  toolkits provide support for building innovative visualizations.&#160; But, few
                  provide the same level of support for multiple views, zooming and panning.
