INTRODUCTION
	
Welcome to PocketPiccolo.NET! PocketPiccolo.NET is a revolutionary way to create robust, full-featured
graphical applications in C#, for Pocket PCs, with striking features such as zooming and multiple
representation.


REQUIRMENTS

Installing Visual Studio 2003 is not necessary, but is recommended.  You will, however, need
the .NET Compact Framework to run PocketPiccolo.NET applications.  You can download it here:

"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=1f62a2a3-7282-4ba9-b26b-2267e972501d&displaylang=en"


SOURCE DISTRIBUTION

Once you unzip the distribution, you will find four subdirectories under the PocketPiccolo.NET
root directory:

    ./Bin     - Contains all the files necessary to use PocketPiccolo.NET
    ./Source  - Contains all of the source code for PocketPiccolo.NET
    ./Samples - Contains Various samples.


BINARY DISTRIBUTION

The binary distribution contains all the files that are in the "./Bin" directory of the Source
distribution


GETTING STARTED

To use the code, open the root directory of the PocketPiccolo.NET distribution you downloaded.  If
you downloaded the Source, open the "./Bin" directory. You will find the following files:

   UMD.HCIL.PocketPiccolo.dll      - This dll contains the PocketPiccolo.NET 2d graphics framework
   UMD.HCIL.PocketPiccoloX.dll     - This dll contains non-essential, but useful PocketPiccolo
                                     framework code.

To use PocketPiccolo, you need to add a reference to UMD.HCIL.PocketPiccolo.dll and
UMD.HCIL.PocketPiccoloX.dll in your Smart Device Visual Studio project.
