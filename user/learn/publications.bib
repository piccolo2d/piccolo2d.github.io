  abstract = {In this paper, we analyze toolkit designs for building graphical applications
	with rich user interfaces, comparing polylithic and monolithic toolkit-based
	solutions. Polylithic toolkits encourage extension by composition
	and follow a design philosophy similar to 3D scene graphs supported
	by toolkits including Java3D and OpenInventor. Monolithic toolkits,
	on the other hand, encourage extension by inheritance, and are more
	akin to 2D Graphical User Interface toolkits such as Swing or MFC.
	We describe Jazz (a polylithic toolkit) and Piccolo (a monolithic
	toolkit), each of which we built to support interactive 2D structured
	graphics applications in general, and Zoomable User Interface applications
	in particular. We examine the trade offs of each approach in terms
	of performance, memory requirements, and programmability. We conclude
	that a polylithic approach is most suitable for toolkit builders,
	visual design software where code is automatically generated, and
	application builders where there is much customization of the toolkit.
	Correspondingly, we find that monolithic approaches appear to be
	best for application builders where there is not much customization
	of the toolkit.},

	Pad. The ongoing Pad project uses a spatial metaphor for computer
	interface design. It provides an intuitive base for the support of
	such applications as electronic marketplaces, information services,
	and on-line collaboration. Pad is an infinite two dimensional information
	plane that is shared among users, much as a network file system is
	shared. Objects are organized geographically; every object occupies
	a well defined region on the Pad surface. For navigation, Pad uses
	&quot;portals &quot;- magnifying glasses that can peer into and roam
	over different parts of this single infinite shared desktop; links
	to specific items are established and broken continually as the portal's
	view changes. Portals can recursively look onto other portals. This
	paradigm enables the sort of peripheral activity generally found
	in real physical working environments. The apparent size of an object
	to any user determines the amount of detail it presents. Different
	users can share and view multiple applications while assigning each
	a desired degree of interaction. Documents can be visually nested
	and zoomed as they move back and forth between primary and secondary
	working attention. Things can be peripherally accessible. In this

	the objects in an image is important in many retrieval tasks, but
	thumbnails generated by shrinking the original image often render
