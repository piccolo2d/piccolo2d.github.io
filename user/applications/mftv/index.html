      MFTV: Multi-faceted Tree Viewer
    </title>

    <p>
      MFTV was built to visualize and inspect some dense linguistic tree data that encode
      ambiguities as alternative branches. We call this type of tree data Multi-faceted Trees. Each
      ambiguous alternative branch is called a face. For one node, only one "face" is shown at a
      time. Other "faces" are represented as choice buttons. This tool is already in use at
      Maryland's Computational Linguistic and Information Processing (CLIP) Lab. Previously, they
      were using lisp print outs to inspect these data structures (usually, more than 20 pages of
      print out for one tree).
    </p>
    <p>
      Since multi-faceted tree is a generalization of tree data, MFTV can be used for any type of
      dense tree data structures. MFTV was developed by <a href="mailto:habash@cs.umd.edu">Nizar
      Habash</a> and <a href="mailto:jintong@cs.umd.edu">Jin Tong</a>, graduate students in the
      Computer Science department at the University of Maryland.

    <p>
      A sample tree is loaded, and a search on primitive "GO" is performed. Blue-highlighted nodes
      contain the primitive "GO". Dark buttons represent an alternative subtrees at that node and
      they can be swapped in by clicking on them. Blue buttons are those alternative subtrees that
      contain primitive "GO". This tree is from a machine-translation project data set.<br />

      Same tree as the above. One alternative branch (face) is swapped in. Node "ACT" was replaced
      by "GO".<br />

      "Semantic Zooming" is used. More detailed content will be shown when zoomed in.
