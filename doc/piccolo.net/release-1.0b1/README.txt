This is the Piccolo.NET README file

INTRODUCTION
	
Welcome to Piccolo.NET! Piccolo is a revolutionary way (in the Jazz ZUI 
tradition) to create robust, full-featured graphical applications in 
C#, with striking features such as zooming and multiple representation. 
Piccolo.NET is an extensive toolkit based on the GDI+ API.

REQUIRMENTS

To run Piccolo.NET applications you need to install the .NET Framework (1.1), 
which can be downloaded from "http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/technologyinfo/howtoget/default.aspx#section3"
Installing Visual Studio 2003 is not necessary, but is recommended.

GETTING STARTED

Piccolo comes with two dlls.
Note, if you downloaded the source release you will have to build these
dlls yourself.

UMD.HCIL.Piccolo.dll  - This dll contains the Piccolo 2d graphics framework
UMD.HCIL.PiccoloX.dll - This dll contains nonessential, but maybe useful Piccolo framework code.
