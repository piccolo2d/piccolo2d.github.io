Jazz-0.4 ChangeLog
------------------

  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
  --------------------

  * 06/15/1999: BBB/JJM - Replaced ZTextField and ZTextArea with a
    combined simpler ZText class.  The new ZText does what the
    two previous classes did, and is a direct replacement.  The
    primary difference is that it supports multi-line text.  In
    addition, it has a different origin.  ZText has the origin
    at the upper-left corner of the text.  ZTextField has the
    origin at the lower-left corner.
				   
  * 06/10/1999: BBB - Reworked ZCamera.findNodes() mechanism.  It used
    to be that this was a specific mechanism to find those nodes that
    intersecte a given area.  It is now a generalized mechanism to find
    those nodes that satisfy a filter criteria.  There is a basic filter
    interface called scenegraph.ZFindFilter, and some specific instances
    that can be used by applications.  Currently, there are 
    util.ZFindFilterBounds and util.ZFindFilterMagBounds.  The former
    finds all nodes that intersect the specified bounds.  The latter
    find the nodes that intersect the specified bounds and who are 
    visible within the specified magnification.

    As part of this change, I added a new "findable" bit to ZVisualComponent
    to complement "pickable".  Now, pickable only applies to the pick
    function, and findable only applies to the find function.

  * 06/09/1999: BBB - Changed ZBasicComponent constructor to accomodate
    simplified repaint model (see below).  Now there is just a default
    constructor that the caller must add to a container - in the traditional
    Java style.  Note that there is now also another constructor that
    that takes a root and a node, and makes the component look onto
    an existing scenegraph.  ZBasicFrame now also has a similar new
    constructor that allows it to look at an existing scenegraph.

  * 06/06/1999: BBB - Renamed ZCamera.getMag() to ZCamera.getMagnification()

  * 06/06/1999: BBB - Renamed ZBasicApplication to ZBasicFrame

  * 06/06/1999: BBB - Moved scenegraph.ZDebug to util.ZDebug

  * 06/06/1999: BBB - Reworked damage/restore a bit.  I removed the
    damage methods that did a built-in restore: damage(boolean restoreNow)
    and damage(boolean restoreNow, ZSurface surface).  More importantly,
    I simplified the way objects need to call damage.  It used to be tha
    when objects changed their bounds, they had to go through a four step
    process (damage(), modify self, updateBounds(), damage()).  Now, the new
    simplified method is to just use a two step process where the object
    modifies itself, and then calls damage(true).

    The new ZNode.damage(boolean boundsChanged) method should be called
    whenever an object has changed its internal data structure that will
    result in a bounds changed.  Calling this will result in the original
    and new area of the object being damaged, plus the new bounds will
    be computed by a call to updateBounds().

  * 05/29/1999: BBB - Removed inadequate thread-safe protection from Jazz.
    Now, Jazz is officially *not* thread-safe, and must be completely
    modified, accessed, and painted from a single thread (usually the
    event dispatch thread).  This was done for the following reasons:
      - Swing is built this way, and most of their rational applies to Jazz.
      - It is easier to write and debug Jazz, and to extend it with new components.
      - It is easier to write applications, and to debug them.
      - Jazz applications can use Swing's utility functions (such as Timers, 
        invokeLater, and invokeAndWait) to make it easier to use other threads
        to do slow tasks, but synchronize them with Jazz.
      - Jazz runs faster because there is no synchronization
    The primary disadvantage is that Jazz will not be directly speeded up when
    run on machines with multiple processors.
    Sun has written three articles on Swing and Threads that discuss threading
    issues, and will be valuable to the Jazz application developer:

  * 05/26/1999: BBB - Renamed ZVisualComponentDecorator.insert()
    to ZVisualComponentDecorator.insertAbove() to make it clear
    that the decorator is being inserted *above* the component
    parameter, and not below it.

  * 05/23/1999: BBB - Moved ZLink from scenegraph to component package,
    and renamed it to ZLinkDecorator.

  * 05/23/1999: BBB - Renamed ZSelection to ZSelectionDecorator

  BUG FIXES
  ---------

  * 06/12/1999: BBB - Fixed bug where strings with an embedded double quote
    character in the first position didn't get written out properly.

  * 06/10/1999: BBB - ZSurface.pick() now only picks items that are within
    their valid size range.  That is, objects which are smaller than their
    minimum size, or larger than their maximum size are not picked.    

  * 06/10/1999: BBB - Fixed ZSurface.printSurface() method so it now
    specifies that there is a single page to print so the dialog
    box shows that properly.  

  * 06/09/1999: BBB - Fixed the nagging problems associated with the connection
    of Jazz to Swing components.  This includes problems where Jazz wouldn't 
    always render onto the entire window, where overlapping Swing components 
    would get overwritten, where the fonts would sometimes alternate between
    high and low quality inconsistently, where Jazz mapped to Swing internal
    frames would be buggy, etc.

    The fixes are a result of a significant internal change where instead of 
    caching the Swing Graphics object, Jazz now uses the standard Swing 
    repaint/paint mechanism.  This simplifies a lot of code, but has the cost
    of slightly slower repaints since the repainting now involves a transformation
    of the dirty region into window coordinates and back again, and also means
    going through the Swing painting code.  However, this is the only solution
    that will work reliably that I could find.

    These changes are mostly backwards compatible, but they introduce a subtle but
    important change.  The default ZSurface.restore() call no longer paints
    immediately - but instead queues a request on the Swing event queue to repaint.
    Swing is single threaded, and that request won't be serviced until after 
    the event listener that triggered the restore call finishes.  If you want
    to paint immediately (such as is necessary when painting within an animation
    loop), you must call restore(true).

  * 06/01/1999: BBB - Fixed ZCamera to no longer assume that surface is non-null.

  * 06/01/1999: BBB - Fixed ZTransform to lo longer assume that parent is non-null.

  * 05/25/1999: BBB - Fixed bug where nodes that were added to children of 
    cameras aren't caught as being sticky, and so they didn't get set to volatile.
    The result is that sub-sticky objects didn't always get their
    bounds computed properly.

  NEW FEATURES
  ------------

  * 06/13/1999: BBB - Added new util.ZBasicWindow class.  It is similar
    to ZBasicFrame, but extends JWindow instead of JFrame.  This provides
    the ability to create a Jazz window without any window dressing.
    ZBasicWindow defaults to filling up the entire screen to make it easy
    to go into full-screen mode.

  * 06/12/1999: BBB - Added "save" property to ZNode.  If you set it to false,
    then that node (and its children) won't be saved.

  * 06/12/1999: BBB - Made ZImage optionally write out link to filename instead
    of embedded image.

  * 06/10/1999: BBB - Substantially improved HiNote - including adding features for
    fading, raising/lowering, hyperlinking, and accelerator keys.

  * 06/10/1999: BBB - Made it so when max mag of ZNode is set to the -1, that feature is 
    disabled, i.e., it is never culled for being too large.

  * 06/10/1999: BBB - Added hyperlink event handler (jazz.event.ZLinkEventHandler)

  * 06/06/1999: BBB - Added fourth chapter to tutorial describing the basics of
    dynamic objects within Jazz.

  * 05/25/1999: BBB - Changed behavior of hidden nodes slightly.  Now, they don't 
    contribute to the bounds of their parents.  Stated from the parent's viewpoint,
    a node's global bounds doesn't include their hidden children.

  * 05/23/1999: BBB - Added new constraint decorator class (component.ZConstraintDecorator)
    to make it easy to create simple constraints that affect where visual
    components appear based on some state.  Used this class to create first
    example constraint - component.ZStickyZDecorator that allows its child
    to pan freely as the camera pans, but when the camera changes magnification,
    the child will remain at the same size.  This can be useful for labels
    on objects that zoom where the labels shouldn't zoom.  Constraint decorators
    can also be used to create objects that don't go off the screen, don't
    shrink below a certain size, or don't overlap certain objects.


	
Jazz-0.3 ChangeLog (Released 05/15/1999)
----------------------------------------

  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
  --------------------

  * 05/15/1999: BBB - Changed these method names in ZCamera:
      getCameraTransform()        => getViewTransform()
      getInverseCameraTransform() => getInverseViewTransform()
      setCameraTransform()        => setViewTransform()
      getCameraViewBounds()       => getViewBounds()

  * 05/15/1999: BBB - Removed ZVisualComponent.appData slot.
    Instead, an application can make a decorator that points to the application
    if it needs this kind of pointer.  It is too big a waste to have every
    visual component keep this pointer around for the few instances that
    will actually use it.

  * 05/10/1999: BBB - Changed package java.components to java.component
    to be consistent with the other package names

  * 05/09/1999: BBB - Replaced ZSerializable.isSavable() with a more 
    general-purpose method - and also one that mimics java's Serializable.  
    Now, there are optional writeReplace() and readResolve() methods that any
    ZSerializable classes can implement.  If they do so, then they can replace
    themselves with another object on the write out, or read in.  If they replace
    themselves with null, then they just don't get written out (or read in).
    In this case, any references to them will be replaced with null.

  * 05/09/1999: BBB - Renamed ZSerializable.ZWriteObject() to writeObject() and
    ZSerializable.ZWriteObjectRecurse() to writeObjectRecurse(). 
    Also, ZWriteObjectRecurse now throws IOException.

  * 05/01/1999: BBB - Changed ZNode.paint so that the visual component gets 
    painted before the children.  This way, a group or camera can paint a 
    background underneath the children.

  * 05/01/1999: BBB - Renamed ZDebug.dumpSubGraph() to ZDebug.dump()

  * 05/01/1999: BBB - Changed signature of ZDebug.setShowBounds(boolean) to
    ZDebug.setShowBounds(boolean, ZCamera)

  * 05/01/1999: BBB - Changed signature of ZVisualComponent.select() to 
    ZVisualComponent.select(ZCamera).  Changed signature of 
    ZVisualComponent.setSelected(boolean) to 
    ZVisualComponent.setSelected(boolean, ZCamera).
    Changed signature of ZNode.selectAll() to ZNode.selectAll(ZCamera)

  BUG FIXES
  ---------

  * 05/15/1999: BBB - Fixed bug where restoration could result in screen turds.  
    The visible area was sometimes one pixel too small, despite it being computed 
    accurately.  This was because of rounding error and/or anti-aliasing.  
    I fixed it by adding a single pixel to the visible area at paint time.

  * 05/15/1999: BBB - Fixed ZImage to work properly even if internal 
    java.awt.image slot is null.

  * 05/15/1999: BBB - Fixed several components to not try to write out 
    color if colors are null.

  * 05/13/1999: BDM - Fixed ZSerialization so that special characters
    in strings (such as double quotes) get properly escaped when written
    out and unescaped when read back in, so all standard characters can
    get written out safely.

  * 05/09/1999: BBB - Wrote out pickable, volatile, and appData (if ZSerializable) 
    fields for ZVisualComponent when ZSerialized.
	
  * 05/09/1999: BBB - Fixed bug in ZCamera.setFillColor() where it wasn't damaging
    the camera - resulting in the camera not being redrawn upon a restore.

  * 05/09/1999: BBB - Fixed ZBasicComponent so that setBackground() changes the
    background color by changing the associated camera's bacground color.

  * 05/09/1999: BBB - Fixed the strange bugs related to rendering within
    components that change! This includes the bug where the bottom strip
    of the drawpad window wouldn't get updated properly.  This also includes
    the bug where Jazz didn't work propery when attached to JInternalFrames 
    in JDesktopPanes.  This all works now.

  * 05/01/1999: BBB - Fixed volatility of components and nodes.  Now, 
    volatility gets properly passed up the tree, so if any component or 
    node is volatile, then all of its parents are as well.

  * 05/01/1999: BBB - Fixed ZSelection class to implement constant-thickness
    rectangle properly. Now, scaling objects doesn't leave screen turds.

  * 05/01/1999: BBB - Fixed show bounds debugging where it would also leave 
    screen turds. 

  NEW FEATURES
  ------------

  * 05/15/1999: BBB - Added new ZProperty class that replaces the old appData.  
    Now, every ZNode can have an optional list of properties - which are just 
    key/value pairs.  Properties get saved with ZSerialization (if the property 
    is ZSerializable).  See ZNode.addProperty(), ZNode.getProperty(), etc.

  * 05/15/1999: BBB - Added some new constructors to ZPolyline, and methods to 
    access points in polyline.

  * 05/15/1999: BBB - Added ZNode.isSticky() method.

  * 05/09/1999: BBB - Renamed DrawPad to HiNote, and complete reorganized the code 
    to allow the same code to either run as an application, or as an applet - but
    each with different menubars.  And, it works as an applet!

  * 05/09/1999: BBB - Created jazz.test package, and added first tester.  TwoSurfaces
    test two surfaces looking onto a single surface.  For now, you can just run 
    the test with the command line ('java TwoSurfaces'), but we will build 
    a GUI to help run the tests.

  * 05/09/1999: BBB - Reconsidered graphics state protocol.  The Graphics2D has the 
    following state that we care about:
        transform, clip, composite (transparency), color, stroke, font
    It used to be that paint methods were required to restore the entire state 
    to how they started.  Instead, now paint methods are not required to restore
    anything.  Jazz now guarantees that the transform, clip, and composite will
    be set properly before any paint methods are called, but a visual component
    should make no assumptions about color and stroke, and thus should set those
    two every time they are used, and don't bother resetting it.

  * 05/09/1999: BBB - Used the new ZSerializable.writeResolve method so that 
    ZSelection now doesn't get saved.  It just skips over itself, writing out
    the next visual component in the chain.

  * 05/09/1999: BBB - Changed the default visual component pick() method to 
    pick using the bounds of the component - rather than just returning false 
    as it was before.  This way, a sub-class doesn't have to override pick 
    if it wants this basic behavior.

  * 05/09/1999: BBB - Added ZArea.add(Rectangle2D) method
	
  * 05/09/1999: BBB - Made the ZBasicApplication constructor take an
    option to either create a plain JFrame, or an internal frame within a desktop.

  * 05/09/1999: BBB - Updated doc/ToDo.  From now on, this will be the
    clearing house of prioritizing bugs and feature requests.

  * 05/01/1999: BBB - Added missing ZTransform.scaleTo() methods.  There are 
    now four that match the scale() methods.  You can now scale or scaleTo
    around an optional point, and with optional animation.

  * 05/01/1999: BBB - Added new static ZTransform.animate() method that 
    animates an array of nodes simultaneously to an array of given transforms.  
    See api docs on usage and example.

  * 05/01/1999: BBB - Added ZTransform.concatenate() and preConcatenate() 
    methods.

  * 05/01/1999: BBB - Added new ZBasicApplication class that is a simple 
    extendable application. It is intended to be used as the base for most 
    applications using Jazz.
