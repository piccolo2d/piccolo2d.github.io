<A NAME="S3"><H1>3. Multiple Representations of Objects</H1>
One of the basic things that Jazz supports is the ability to present
different visual representations of data in different cirumstances.
Because many different kinds of context can be used to influence how
and what gets drawn, we sometimes call this <em>context-sensitive rendering</em>.
While an application can use any context whatsoever to control an object's
rendering (such as author, or time), two especially common contexts are
magnification and camera.  We sometimes use the more specific term <em>semantic zooming</em>
to refer to objects that change the way they appear based on the current
magnification.  When an object appears differently when viewed with
different camera, we sometimes use term <em>lens</em> or <em>filter</em>.

<A NAME="S3.1"><H2>3.1. Context-Sensitive Rendering</H2>
The standard visual components that Jazz is packaged with always render themselves
the same way.  That is, a rectangle is always rendered as a rectangle.  However,
an application can define a new visual component whose paint method depends on
various contexts.  The context could include just about anything, ranging
from the time or author, to an underlying data model that this object represents.
<P>
Imagine an application that wants to render a scatter plot.  It could create
a new <tt>ScatterPlot</tt> class that extends <tt>ZVisualComponent</tt> and whose
<tt>paint</tt> method references an underlying data model.  Whenever the data model
changes, the ScatterPlot class would be notified, and would re-render itself based
on the new data.  Similarly, the ScatterPlot class might include in its paint method
the ability to control which points get rendered based on a GUI.  So, this really 
is just a fancy way of saying that an application-defined visual component can
render itself any way that it wants.
<P>
Because we envision many visual components relying on underlying data model,
we have defined a very simple class called <tt>ZModel</tt> whose sole purpose is
to generate events when a model has changed to notify the visual component of
the change. (ZModel is not implemented yet)
<p>

<p>
This simple approach is fine except that it couples the different representations
of the data.  This might make perfect sense if there is really is only kind of
representation, but the details change based on some underlying data.  However,
it is also possible that an application wants the opportunity to have
several completely different visual representations of some data.  For instance,
a basic data model might also support a textual table view, or a bar chart view
in addition to a scatter plot view.
<p>
An important design consideration for multiple representations is to implement
each representation separate from the others.  This allows the application builder
to design new representations, and modify old ones without affecting the other
representations.  Thus, it would be nice to design a different class for each
visual representation of the data.  One design that accomplishes this is to
make a special visual component that acts as a <em>proxy</em> for another
visual component, and can switch between them.
<p>

<b>Multiple visual components accessed through a delegator</b>
</CENTER>
<p>
Such a switcher is fairly straightforward to build.  It would maintain a
list of ancillary visual components and exactly one of them would be
active at a time.  It would then define its <tt>paint</tt>, <tt>pick</tt>, 
and <tt>computeLocalBounds</tt> methods to call the active visual component.

<A NAME="S3.2"><H2>3.2. Semantic Zooming</H2>
Now that we understand the basic ways that an application can define
multiple representations of an object, we must define interface methods 
for selecting between representations.  As we mentioned, one approach is
to use the magnification of a camera to choose the representation for the data.
This might make sense if you wanted to show more detail when you zoom in.
<P>
Assuming that you have defined a vector of visual components, the following
sample code will call a different component to paint every time you zoom in
by a factor of 4.
<PRE>
    public void paint(ZRenderContext renderContext) {
	float mag = renderContext.getCompositeMagnification();
	level = (int)(mag / 4);
	try {
	    ZVisualComponent vis = (ZVisualComponent)visualizers.get(level);
	    vis.paint(renderContext);
	} catch (Exception e) {
				// Level not loaded
	    Graphics2D g2 = renderContext.getGraphics2D();
	    g2.setColor(Color.red);
	    g2.fill3DRect(0, 0, 100, 100, true);
	    g2.setColor(Color.black);
	    g2.setFont(new Font("Helvetica", Font.PLAIN, 10));
	    g2.drawString("Level not loaded", 5, 50);
	}
    }
</PRE>

<A NAME="S3.3"><H2>3.3. Internal Cameras (Lenses)</H2>
Some previous systems have used an interface technique sometimes called
<em>lenses</em> or <em>filters</em> to switch between different visual representations.
The idea is that there is an object on the screen that you can drag around,
and when you drag it it looks onto the scene, but some things look different
when seen through these special objects.
<P>
Jazz supports this representation-switching interface simply by putting another
camera in the scenegraph, and setting up the top-level camera to see the
internal camera.  The internal camera then gets rendered as a regular object
that happens to render itself by painting all things that it sees.  The trick is
that by using multiple visual components with a component switcher as we just
described, we can then use the current rendering camera as the context to decide
which visual component to show.  As long as the cameras can be uniquely
identified, this simple approach works fine.
<P>
Thus, with a general camera metaphor and a general approach to supporting
multiple representations, we can support an interface for changing
the way things look based on the camera that looks at them.  The following
sample code will call a different component to paint itself based
on which camera is painting the object.

<PRE>
    public void paint(ZRenderContext renderContext) {
        ZCamera camera = renderContext.getRenderingCamera();
                          // Some code to determine which camera is looking at us
	// int id = ...;
	try {
	    ZVisualComponent vis = (ZVisualComponent)visualizers.get(id);
	} catch (Exception e) {
				// We don't recognize this camera, use default vis.
	    ZVisualComponent vis = defaultVis;
	}
	vis.paint(renderContext);
    }
</PRE>
