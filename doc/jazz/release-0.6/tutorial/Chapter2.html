<A NAME="S2"><H1>2. Using Jazz</H1>

Now that you've seen the basic components of Jazz, and have created a simple program,
lets look at making a more interesting scene.  We'll start with one of the most
important node types - <tt>ZTransformGroup</tt> which allows you to move things
within the Jazz world.

<A NAME="S2.1"><H2>2.1. Transforms</H2>

Jazz specifies all transformations of objects and cameras with
standard 2D affine transformations.  Affine transforms map 2D
coordinate to other 2D coordinates in a manner that preserves
straightness and "parallelness" of lines.  Affine transforms can
represent any combination of translation, scale, rotation, and shear.
In Jazz, affine transforms are implemented using standard Java2D affine transforms.
They are contained within the
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZTransformGroup.html">ZTransformGroup</A></TT>
group node.  Inserting one of these nodes in the scenegraph applies its transform
to the entire subtree below that node.

<P>
Affine transforms consist of 6 numbers
which are typically represented in a 3x3 matrix where multiplying the
transform T by the vector V results in V'.

<PRE>
         [V'] = [T][V]
     or
         [x']   [m00 m01 m02] [x]   [m00x + m01y + m02] 
         [y'] = [m10 m11 m12] [y] = [m10x + m11y + m12] 
         [1 ]   [  0   0   1] [1]   [1]
</PRE>

The documentation for ZTransformGroup explains affine transforms in more
detail.
<tt>ZTransformGroup</tt> has several methods for modifying aspects 
of the transform, such as scale, rotate, and translate.  It is also possible
to animate those changes over time with those methods - or to specify
the new transform with a standard Java2D AffineTransform.

<A NAME="S2.1.1"><H3>2.1.1. Transforming Visual Elements</H3>
The Jazz scenegraph specifies a hierarchy of objects that exist in the
Jazz global coordinate system.  When objects are created as visual
components within nodes, they exist at their default position in the
world.  For instance, an image is positioned with its top-left corner
at the origin extending to the right and down.  If you want the image
to appear somewhere else, it must be moved (also called 'transformed').

<P>
In Jazz, <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZVisualComponent.html">ZVisualComponent</A></TT>
which is used to represent visual
elements, do not have the ability to be transformed. Instead, a transform
node must be inserted above the node that contains the visual component.
The transform applies to the entire subtree of that node.  So, if there are
several children of that node, a single transform node will apply to 
all of those children.
Note that a single visual component can be reused in several places
in the scenegraph.  If those places are each transformed differently,
a single visual component can appear in multiple places.

<P>
There are two equally valid ways of thinking about the effects of
transforms.  The first (and typical) way of thinking about transforms
is that the transform changes the place within the global coordinate
system that the affected objects appear at.  For instance, if you have
a transform node 'transformNode', and you call:
<PRE>
     transformNode.translate(50.0f, 0.0f);
</PRE>
The result is that the children of 'transformNode' (and their descendants)
all get translated 50 units to the right.

<P>
Alternatively, you can think of transforms as representing nested
coordinate systems.  Then, that same call to <tt>translate</tt> would result in
'transformNode' being associated with a new coordinate system that is shifted 50
units to the right of the global coordinate system.  Then, the visual
component associated with transformNode and all of its children would appear at
their normal places within the new coordinate system, but to find out
where those objects are in global coordinates, you would have to
transform the local coordinate system to global coordinates.

<P>
Jazz has several utility methods for converting between
different coordinate systems.  By definition, we say that the root of the Jazz
scenegraph is in global coordinates.  Every other node is in its own local
coordinate system.  These utility methods (such as <tt>ZNode.localToGlobal</tt>
and <tt>ZNode.globalToLocal</tt>) convert points and rectangles from one
coordinate system to the other.

<A NAME="S2.1.2"><H3>2.1.2. Transforming Cameras</H3>
Just as transforms are used to modify visual elements within a
scenegraph, transforms can be used to modify where a camera looks onto
the scenegraph.  <TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZCamera.html">ZCamera</A></TT>
has a view transform with methods for manipulating the view which are
very similar to those in <tt>ZTransformGroup</tt>.
These methods let you translate, scale, rotate, and animate camera view changes.

<p>
The key thing to keep in
mind here is that transforming internal nodes have the effect of
moving objects within the scenegraph while transforming the camera
doesn't affect the scenegraph, but instead changes where a particular
camera looks onto the world represented by the scenegraph.

<A NAME="S2.2"><H2>2.2. Edit Groups</H2>

For an application to use a transform as just described, it would
have to create an instance of a transform node, and insert it into
the scenegraph in the appropriate place.  Similarly, an application
might insert other node types, such as fade or selection nodes above
a particular node in order to add those features.  This can become
somewhat complicated because for each node that the application cares
about, there could be a few extra nodes modifying that node.  In addition,
there is typically a preferred ordering to these nodes (i.e., transform
goes above selection so that the selection moves with the transform).

<P>
To support applications in managing these sets of nodes, Jazz has a 
utility called an "editor" that manages these "edit groups".  Lets start
by thinking about a single node that an application knows about and 
wants to manipulate.  The application first decides that it wants to
add a transform to that node.  It does this by getting the editor for
that node, and requesting a transform:
<PRE>
    ZTransformGroup transformNode = node.editor().getTransformGroup();
</PRE>
This will create a new transform node, and insert it above the node.
Editors are careful in managing these extra nodes, and the next time
you ask for the transform of that node, it will return the same
transform.  We use the terminology that the node that we start
with is called the "primary node", all the extra nodes that are
created by the editor are called "edit nodes", and the collection of 
primary and edit nodes altogether are called an "edit group".
Given any member of an edit group, you can access the primary node
with <tt>editor.getNode()</tt>, and you can access the top-most
member of the edit group with <tt>editor.getTop()</tt>.

<P>
The editor manages these edit nodes types:
<ul>
<li>ZInvisibleGroup 
<li>ZLayoutGroup 
<li>ZAnchorGroup 
<li>ZTransformGroup 
<li>ZStickyGroup 
<li>ZSelectionGroup 
<li>ZFadeGroup 
</ul>

<P>
Edit groups are defined through the use of <tt>ZGroup</tt>'s 
<tt>hasOneChild</tt> bit.  Any group can have this bit set which
then does not allow that group to have more than one child.
Given a primary node, those immediate ancestors which have that bit set
are considered to edit the primary node.  The first ancestor which
does not have that bit set starts a new edit group.

<P>
Jazz provides a default editor with
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/util/ZSceneGraphEditor.html">ZSceneGraphEditor</A></TT>.
An instance of the editor is created whenever <tt>node.editor()</tt> is called.
However, an application can extend or change the definition of th editor
by specifying that a different editor should be used.  This is done by
defining an application-specific editor, and calling the static method
<tt>ZNode.setEditorFactory()</tt>, and specifying a factory that creates
that special editor.

<A NAME="S2.3"><H2>2.3. Creating New Visual Components</H2>

As we saw in <A HREF="Chapter1.html#S1.2.1">Section 1.2.1</A>, every
visual element is represented as a 
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZVisualComponent.html">ZVisualComponent</A></TT>
in the scenegraph.   Jazz has several standard visual components, but applications
may want to create their own.
In order to create new component types, applications must extend <tt>ZVisualComponent</tt>.
Minimally, an application must define:
<UL>
    <LI><TT>paint(Graphics2D)</TT> which tells Jazz how to render
    the visual element.  Jazz guarantees that the Graphics2D transform,
    clip, and composite are set before the component's paint method
    is called.  However, the component must set the color, font, and stroke
    if they are used.  The component must restore Graphics2D transform,
    clip, and composite state if they are changed.
    <LI><TT>computeBounds()</TT> which tells Jazz how to compute the
    bounds of the visual component. Jazz does not compute the bounds
    every time it needs it, rather it caches the result,
    and only recomputes it when the component has been reshaped.
</UL>
In addition, visual components will frequently decide to override:
<UL>
    <LI><TT>boolean pick(Rectangle2D, ZSceneGraphPath path)</TT>
</UL>
This tells Jazz how to "pick" the visual element.  Picking is used to
determine if the object is under the pointer.  The default implementation
for pick is just to check if the pointer is within the bounds of the component.
If a new visual component's shape is not a filled rectangle that is the
same as the bounds, then a new pick method should probably be defined.
A simple example of this is a circle which should not be pickable outside
of the circle.
<p>
Finally, the visual element is responsible for creating itself and
for supporting manipulation of itself.  We must look at the details of
manipulating an object in some detail.  This is because Jazz
determines when to render an component based on its <em>bounds</em>,
and because components are responsible for indicating to Jazz when they
have changed through the <tt>repaint()</tt> and <tt>reshape()</tt> methods.
<p>
Every visual component must maintain a "model", or an internal data
structure that represents the object.  For a circle, this may be as
simple as a center point, radius, and pen color.  For other objects,
the model may be more complex.  Typical components will support
methods that modify itself.  The circle may have methods, for
instance, to modify its pen width or pen color.  It is the responsibility
of these methods to indicate they have changed by calling <tt>repaint()</tt>
if the object needs repainting, but the bounds have not changed 
(i.e., see ZCircle.setPenColor below) - or
by calling <tt>reshape()</tt> if their bounds have changed
(i.e., see ZCircle.setPenWidth below).

<A NAME="S2.3.1"><H3>2.3.1. An Example: <TT>ZCircle</TT></H3>
<TT>ZCircle</TT> maintains a model of a <TT>Ellipse2D.Float</TT> whose height is
equal to it's width. In addition, it also has a <TT>penWidth</TT>,
<TT>penColor</TT>, and a <TT>fillColor</TT>.

<A NAME="S2.4"><H2>2.4. Adding Custom Event Handlers</H2>

User interaction is a fundamental part of any program and in Jazz this
is no exception.  Jazz directly supports event processing by allowing
applications to create event handlers for mouse events, and attach
them directly to any node in the Jazz scenegraph.  If a user clicks
on a visual component, any nodes it is attached to will be searched
for event handlers, and if there any, they will be fired.  Then,
if the event is not consumed, the event will percolate up the tree
firing event handlers as it goes up until either the event is
consumed, or it reaches the root.

<p>
With this percolation model, applications can write an event handler
for a specific node by putting the event handler on that node.  
Or, it can write an event handler for all nodes by putting the
event handler at the root of the tree. Finally, an application
can write a different event handler for each camera by putting
the event handler on the node that contains the camera.

<P>
Jazz has several standard event handlers which can
be used directly by applications.  They are:
<UL>
    <LI><B><TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/event/ZPanEventHandler.html">ZPanEventHandler</A></TT></B>
    provides basic panning of a Jazz camera with the left mouse
    button. Clicking and dragging the mouse translates the camera so
    that the point on the surface stays under the mouse.

    <LI><B><TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/event/ZoomEventHandler.html">ZoomEventHandler</A></TT></B>
    provides basic zooming of a Jazz camera with the right mouse
    button. The inital mouse press defines the zoom anchor
    point. Moving the mouse to the right zooms in with a speed that is
    proportional to the amount the mouse is moved and moving the mouse
    to the left zooms out. 

    <LI><B><TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/event/ZNavEventHandlerKeyBoard.html">ZNavEventHandlerKeyBoard</A></TT></B>
    provides event handlers for basic zooming and panning of a Jazz
    camera with the keyboard. While the application can define which
    keys are used for navigation and how much each key moves the camera,
    the default is for PageUp to zoom in 25% and PageDown to zoom out
    25% animated over 250 milliseconds. Auto-repeat is also supported.
    
    <LI><B><TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/event/ZSelectionEventHandler.html">ZSelectionEventHandler</A></TT></B>
    provides basic selection interaction. Visual elements are
    selected/unselected by clicking on them. Shift-click will extend
    the selection and click-and-drag the background to marquee
    select. Once selected, visual elements can be moved by dragging
    them on the screen.

    <LI><B><TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/event/ZLinkEventHandler.html">ZLinkEventHandler</A></TT></B>
    provides interaction for authoring hyperlinks.  Click on an object
    to define a link from that object, and then click on another object
    to define a link to that second object as a destination.  This
    inserts a ZAnchorGroup which can then be used to follow the link.
</UL>

The built-in event handlers are straight-forward to use.  They must
simply be instantiated (attaching it to the appropriate node in the scenegraph),
and activated.  For instance, ZCanvas attaches the pan and zoom event handlers
by default by doing this:
<PRE>
    panEventHandler = new ZPanEventHandler(cameraNode);
    zoomEventHandler = new ZoomEventHandler(cameraNode);
    panEventHandler.setActive(true);
    zoomEventHandler.setActive(true);
</PRE>

Obviously, it will become necessary to provide your own event handlers
for the many things that you will want your application to do. Thus
Jazz provides 
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/event/ZEventHandler.html">ZEventHandler</A></TT>
which is an interface that may be implemented when defining Jazz event handlers.
Although the use of ZEventHandler is not required, it is useful because that way
a single object can be marked as being an event handler, and it can be passed around,
and made active or inactive.

<p>
When writing per-node Jazz event handlers, it is important to understand the
algorithm that Jazz follows to fire event handlers when events arrive.  
For each mouse or mouse motion event, Jazz calls 
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZDrawingSurface.html#pick(int, int)">ZDrawingSurface.pick</A></TT>
which identifies the object that the pointer was over.  The path returned
by the pick call is used to identify event handlers as follows:
<p>
Starting at the <em>end</em> of the path, the first node is found and
<ol>
<li>Each event handler on that node is fired starting at the
<em>most-recently added</em> one.  If the event is consumed, then no
more event handlers are fired.
<li>If the event is consumed, stop.  Else, the next node up the path is found, and 
Jazz returns to step 1.
</ol>

<A NAME="S2.4.1"><H3>2.4.1 An Example: <TT>squiggleEventHandler</TT></H3>

As an example of a event handler, we provide a
<TT>squiggleEventHandler</TT> which allows for mouse interaction to
draw squiggles on the desktop. A squiggle is drawn on the desktop by
clicking the mouse button and then dragging the mouse. The squiggle
stops when the mouse button is released. Thus, the
<TT>squiggleEventHandler</TT> needs provide the following
functionality:
<UL>
    <LI><TT>mousePressed</TT> event is what starts the act of drawing
    a squiggle. The event handler will grab the position of the mouse
    at the time that the mouse button was pressed, transform it to
    world coordinates and store it. It then needs to create a polyline
    that will be used to store the squiggle and add it to the
    scenegraph.

    <LI><TT>mouseDragged</TT> event gets the next position of the
    mouse, transforms it to world coordinates, and adds it to the
    already created polyline.

    <LI><TT>mouseReleased</TT> event cleans up.

<A NAME="S2.5"><H2>2.5. Jazz and Threads</H2>

Jazz is <b>not</b> thread-safe.  Like Swing, Jazz has been designed from the
start to run <b>only</b> in a single thread (usually the event dispatch thread).
This constrains the way Jazz applications can be built, but we feel that overall,
it increases usability by simplifying code, and eliminating thread-debugging issues.
<p>
An excellent starting point for learning about threads is to read what Sun has
written about Swing and threads.  Almost all of their solutions for multi-threaded
code work for Jazz as well.  Here are links to three major articles.
<a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jfc/tsc/archive/tech_topics_arch/threads/threads.html">
Threads and Swing</a>, 
<a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jfc/tsc/archive/tech_topics_arch/swing_worker/swing_worker.html">
Using a SwingWorker Thread</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jfc/tsc/tech_topics/threads3/threads3.html">
The Last Word in Swing Threads</a>.
<p>
There are a few good reasons where it may be appropriate to run some code in a separate
thread, such as with asynchronous animation.  The following code will zoom in while 
the rest of the application is still active, and responds to events.  It uses the Swing
Timer class which will call an ActionListener at regular intervals.  The trick is that
the listener is always called in the primary Swing event thread.

<PRE>
import javax.swing.SwingUtilities;
import edu.umd.cs.jazz.*;

public class AnimTest {
    private boolean zooming = false;               // True during animated zooming
    private ZCamera camera = null;                 // Caller must specify camera animation should occur within

    public AnimTest(ZCamera camera) {
        this.camera = camera;
    }

    // Start the animation
    public void startZooming() {
	zooming = true;
	zoomOneStep();
    }

    // Stop the animation
    public void stopZooming() {
	zooming = false;
    }

    // This gets called to zoom one step
    public void zoomOneStep() {
	if (zooming) {
	    camera.scale(1.1f, 0.0f, 0.0f);

	    try {
				// The sleep here is necessary.  Otherwise, there won't be
				// time for the primary event thread to get and respond to
				// input events.
		Thread.sleep(20);

				// If the sleep was interrupted, then cancel the zooming,
				// so don't do the next zooming step
		SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
		    public void run() {
			AnimTest.this.zoomOneStep();
		    }
		});
	    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
		zooming = false;
	    }
	}
    }
}
</PRE>

<p>
This is a summary of the reasons we chose to build Jazz to run within a single thread:
<ul>
<li>Swing is built this way, and most of Sun's rational applies to Jazz.
<li>It is easier to write and debug Jazz, and to extend it with new components.
<li>It is easier to write applications, and to debug them.
<li>Jazz applications can use Swing's utility functions (such as Timers, 
        invokeLater, and invokeAndWait) to make it easier to use other threads
        to do slow tasks, but synchronize them with Jazz.
<li>Jazz runs faster because there is no synchronization
</ul>
    The primary disadvantage is that Jazz will not be directly speeded up when
    run on machines with multiple processors.

<A NAME="S2.6"><H2>2.6. Swing and Jazz</H2>

Clearly, Jazz is not independent from Swing.  In fact, Jazz functions
as a Swing widget itself through <TT><A
HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/util/ZCanvas.html">ZCanvas</A></TT> where
it displays a Jazz <TT><A
HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZDrawingSurface.html">ZDrawingSurface</A></TT>.
However, Swing widgets themselves can also be embedded within Jazz through
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/component/ZSwing.html">ZSwing</A></TT>.
<TT>ZSwing</TT> acts as a Jazz Visual Component wrapper for the Swing widget to
ensure its proper rendering, focusing, and bounds management
within Jazz.

<P>
One Swing widget that requires special attention in Jazz is the
<TT>JPopupMenu</TT>.  Unfortunately, this also affects <TT>JMenu</TT>
and <TT>JComboBox</TT> as these both maintain an instance of
<TT>JPopupMenu</TT>.  The fundamental problem with <TT>JPopupMenu</TT>
is that it is always potentially heavyweight (for instance, the popup
can extend outside the bounds of its parent window).  Consequently,
care must be excercised when using a <TT>JPopupMenu</TT> in Jazz.  A
<TT>JPopupMenu</TT> should likely be managed at the level of the <TT><A
HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/util/ZCanvas.html">ZCanvas</A></TT>
rather than at the level of embedded Swing widgets.  <TT>JMenu</TT>
and <TT>JComboBox</TT> should also <b>not</b> be used with <TT><A
HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/component/ZSwing.html">ZSwing</A></TT>. Instead, use
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/component/ZMenu.html">ZMenu</A></TT> and
<TT><A
HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/component/ZComboBox.html">ZComboBox</A></TT>
exactly as you would their Swing counterparts, then add them to a
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZSwing.html">ZSwing</A></TT>.
    
<A NAME="S2.7"><H2>2.7. Saving Jazz Scenegraphs</H2>

Jazz supports two mechanisms for saving scenegraphs.  Jazz classes support standard
Java Serialization which allows a class, or an entire scenegraph to be written
to disk in a compact binary format.  This is the recommended way to save Jazz
scenegraphs.  However, the risk with this format is that as Jazz is still under
active development, we expect that until release 1.0, the Jazz internal structure
will continue to change, and Serialized files will not be readable with future
versions of Jazz.

<P>
To address this problem of incompatible file formats, Jazz also supports a custom
file format which is more (although not completely) version resistant.  It is
a more bulky and also text-based file format.  We expect that after Jazz stabilizes,
we may introduce an XML based file format, and will eliminate this special format.
This special file format is directly analogous to Java Serialization.  Jazz classes
implement the ZSerializable method and has similar readObject and writeObject methods
that can be used just like Serializable objects.

<P>
Note that one difference between Java Serialization and Jazz ZSerialization is that
Serialization follows all internal references, and thus if you try to write out
any single node, all the pointers will be followed, and it will
end up writing out the entire scenegraph including the cameras.  ZSerialization,
on the other hand, does not write out "up" pointers, and so if you write out
a node with ZSerialization, it will only write out the sub-tree rooted at the 
node you specify.  If you want to accomplish this functionality using Serialization,
your best bet is to disconnect that subtree from the rest of the scenegraph with
<tt>"getParent().removeChild(this);"</tt>, write it out, and then add the subtree back.

<P>
Unlike Java Serialization, Jazz ZSerialization is not completely automated.  In order
to make a class ZSerializable, the class must implement the
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/io/ZSerializable.html">ZSerializable</A></TT>.
interface, <em>and</em> it must write out and read the slots it cares about.  It does not
automatically write out non-transient slots like Serialization does.  In addition,
A ZSerializable must have a public no-arg constructor, or it will generate a
ClassCastException when being read back in.

<A NAME="S2.8"><H2>2.8. Jazz Class Structure</H2>

The best way to learn the details of Jazz is look at the API docs.  However,
is a summary of the Jazz class structure that may be helpful in understanding
all the pieces in one overview.
The following figure shows the Jazz scenegraph class structure.  
Then the following sections discuss each node type, and the functionality
they provide.

<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="ch2-class-structure.png"><br>
<b>The class hierarchy of the Jazz scenegraph objects.</b>
</CENTER>

<P>
Nodes are of two basic types: leaves and groups.  A leaf node is one that
has no children.  A group node has children.  Some leaves (<TT>ZVisualLeaf</TT>)
and some groups (<TT>ZVisualGroup</TT>) can render visual components.  Other node
types do not cause any actual rendering, but can provide functionality
in other ways.  For instance, a <TT>ZTransformGroup</TT> modifies the transform
for all of its children.  Let us look at each node type.

<A NAME="S2.8.1"><H3>2.8.1. ZRoot</H3>

Every scenegraph begins with a
<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZRoot.html">ZRoot</A></TT>
which serves as the root of the entire scenegraph tree.  Each scenegraph
has exactly one root.

<A NAME="S2.8.2"><H3>2.8.2. ZLeaf</H3>

<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZLeaf.html">ZLeaf</A></TT>
serves as a tag, identifying all sub-classes as being leaves.  <TT>ZLeaf</TT>
provides no other function, and there is no reason to instantiate
a ZLeaf object.

<A NAME="S2.8.3"><H3>2.8.3. ZVisualLeaf</H3>

<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZVisualLeaf.html">ZVisualLeaf</A></TT>
is a leaf node with a visual component.  Many applications will attach
all of their visual components to <tt>ZVisualLeaf</tt>s.

<A NAME="S2.8.4"><H3>2.8.4. ZGroup</H3>

<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZGroup.html">ZGroup</A></TT>
is a node with children.  Applications may use <tt>ZGroup</tt> to 
"group" children.  By inserting a group node above several children,
the group node can then be manipulated which will affect all of its
children.  Groups are typically used when several objects should be
treated as a semantic unit.

<A NAME="S2.8.5"><H3>2.8.5. ZFadeGroup</H3>

<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZFadeGroup.html">ZFadeGroup</A></TT>
is a group node that controls transparency and fading of its sub-tree.
Inserting a fade node into the tree lets you control transparency
and minimum/maximum magnification of all its descendants.  
If this node is rendered below its minimum magnification, or above
its maximum magnification, it and its children will not be rendered.
The node and its subtree will be smoothly faded out as the minimum
or maximum magnification is approached.

<A NAME="S2.8.6"><H3>2.8.6. ZLayerGroup</H3>

<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZLayerGroup.html">ZLayerGroup</A></TT>
is used exclusively to specify the portion of the scenegraph that a camera
can see.  It has no other function.  See <tt>ZCamera</tt> for more detail.

<A NAME="S2.8.7"><H3>2.8.7. ZAnchorGroup</H3>

<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZAnchorGroup.html">ZAnchorGroup</A></TT>
holds the information for a spatial hyperlink.  An anchor represents a hyperlink
from its children to an internally specified destination.  Anchors can link
to either another node, or to a bounds.  There is an associated event handler
<tt>ZLinkEventHandler</tt> that provides interaction for specifying these links.

<A NAME="S2.8.8"><H3>2.8.8. ZInvisibleGroup</H3>

<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZInvisibleGroup.html">ZInvisibleGroup</A></TT>
makes all the nodes below it completely invisible.  This can be inserted
into a scenegraph when a portion of the tree needs to be temporarily hidden.

<A NAME="S2.8.9"><H3>2.8.9. ZVisualGroup</H3>

<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZVisualGroup.html">ZVisualGroup</A></TT>
is a group node with visual components.  It has two visual components (either or
both of which could be null) which get rendered before and after the node's
children, respectively.  

<A NAME="S2.8.10"><H3>2.8.10. ZSelectionGroup</H3>

<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZSelectionGroup.html">ZSelectionGroup</A></TT>
is a visual group that provides functionality for specifying selection.
Inserting a selection group in the scenegraph will visually select 
its subtree.  It has utility methods for selecting and unselecting nodes.
It manages a visual component that actually represents the selection.
This class could be extended to replace the visual component if an
application wants to define a different visual look.

<A NAME="S2.8.11"><H3>2.8.11. ZLayoutGroup</H3>

<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZLayoutGroup.html">ZLayoutGroup</A></TT>
is a visual group that wraps a layout manager that can position the 
node's children.  The layout manager may also include a visual component
that aids the layout.  For instance, the tree layout manager adds links
connecting the tree nodes.  

<A NAME="S2.8.12"><H3>2.8.12. ZTransformGroup</H3>

<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZTransformGroup.html">ZTransformGroup</A></TT>
is a group node that specifies an arbitrary affine transform.  This provides
the capability to translate, scale, rotate, or shear the subtree of this node.

<A NAME="S2.8.13"><H3>2.8.13. ZConstraintGroup</H3>

<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZConstraintGroup.html">ZConstraintGroup</A></TT>
is a transform group that changes its transform based on a computation defined
in a specified method.  Every time the camera view is changed, the method
is called, recomputing the transform.  Thus, depending on the algorithm chosen,
various dynamic behaviors can be created.  See ZStickyGroup.

<A NAME="S2.8.14"><H3>2.8.14. ZStickyGroup</H3>

<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZStickyGroup.html">ZStickyGroup</A></TT>
is a constraint group that moves its children inversely to the camera view,
so that the children stay visually on the same place on the screen, even
as the camera view changes.  The sticky node has a variation called sticky "Z"
which allows its children to pan with camera changes, but not zoom.

<A NAME="S2.8.15"><H3>2.8.15. ZDrawingSurface</H3>

<TT><A HREF="../api/edu/umd/cs/jazz/ZDrawingSurface.html">ZDrawingSurface</A></TT> 
represents the thing the camera renders onto.  Typically, a drawing surface
will be associated with a ZCanvas window.
However, a drawing surface can also represent a printer, and thus rendering to
a window and printer is implemented in the same way.  The drawing surface
is associated with a window or printer by specifying which Graphics2D to
render onto.
