                </p>
                <p>
                  No. Piccolo is <b>not</b> thread-safe. Piccolo has been designed from the start
                  to run <b>only</b> in a single thread (usually the event dispatch thread). This
                  constrains the way Piccolo applications can be built, but we feel that overall,
                  it increases usability by simplifying code, and eliminating thread-debugging
                  issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Of course, you can still build multi-threaded applications.&#160; The key is to
                  invoke any updates on the main event dispatch thread.&#160; For java, use the
                  <code>invokeLater()</code> method and for .NET use
                  <code>BeginInvoke()</code>.<br />
                  <br />

                <p>
                  The best way to see what's taking so long is to run your code in a profiler.
                  Often the results will surprise you. If you can't get a profiler, then you might
                  try commenting out parts of you application and seeing how that affects
                  performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you are drawing a large number of nodes, rendering may be the bottleneck.
                  There two ways to tackle this problem: make the individual nodes draw faster, or
                  draw fewer nodes. Drawing strokes that have a width of more then one pixel seems
                  to be a fairly expensive operation. If you are using PPath, try setting the
                  stroke paint or pen to null and see how that affects performance. If you need to
                  render the strokes, you could try setting the stroke width to zero, which has the
                  effect of always drawing a one-pixel wide stroke. For PImage nodes, you might try
                  using lower resolution images during animated transitions. Drawing fewer nodes is
                  more difficult. You could try a <a class="main_pane"
                  href="patterns.shtml#Semantic%20Zooming">semantic zooming</a> pattern, where you
                  decide what to draw based on the scale that a node is being viewed at. For
                  instance, you might have one large parent node that contains many smaller child
                  "detail" nodes. To improve performance, you could only draw those detail nodes
                  when you are zoomed in on them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you try the above approaches and things are still slow, your application may
                  be caught in a soft infinite loop. This loop is created when you change an
                  attribute in your scene that requires a repaint, while you are in the process of
                  painting your scene. It will create a problem where you CPU will be active even
                  when your not interacting with the scene graph. You can check if you are in this
                  situation by setting the <code>PDebug.debugPaintCalls</code> flag.&#160; It will
                  print a warning to <code>System.err</code> in Java and
                  <code>System.Console.Error</code> in .NET if repaint is called when the canvas is
                  getting painted.&#160; Note this might happen occasionally when the application
                  is loaded and initialized, but if it turns into a recursive process something is
                  going wrong.
                </p><b class="dark_heading_two"><a name="q3" id="q3"></a>Why are the bounds of my
                nodes incorrect?</b><br />
                <br />
                 You may be confused between bounds and transforms.&#160; There are two ways to
                modify the position and size of a node. You can modify the node's <i>bounds</i> or
                you can modify the <i>affine transform</i> that is applied to that node. 
                <p>
                  Each node has an affine transform that defines a local coordinate system for that
                  node.&#160; If you're not sure what that means, check out the
                  <a class="main_pane" href="graphics.shtml#Transformations">Geometric
                  Transformations</a> section of the Graphics Primer.&#160; If you position a node
                  by calling a method like <code>TranslateBy()</code>, <code>RotateBy()</code>,
                  <code>ScaleBy()</code>, <code>OffsetBy()</code>, and many others, you are
                  modifying the node's transform.&#160; Each transformation you apply defines a new
                  coordinate system, with a new origin.&#160; For example, if you set a node's
                  bounds to (0, 0) and then translate node by (10, 10) you will define a new
                  coordinate system for that node with an origin at (10, 10).&#160; See the
                  <a class="main_pane" href="graphics.shtml#coordinate">Coordinate Systems</a>
                  section of the Graphics Primer.&#160; The bounds however will still be at
                  location (0, 0) because they are stored in the local coordinate system of the
                  node.&#160; That is (0, 0) now refers to the new origin at (10, 10) in global
                  coordinates.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                  Transforms are also hierarchical.&#160; That means if you modify a node's
                  transform, it will affect that node and all of its children.&#160; Let's suppose
                  you add a child to the node described above and set its bounds to (0, 0).&#160;
                  The new node will appear at (10, 10) because the transform of the parent is
                  applied down the hierarchy.&#160; Now, let's suppose you translate the new node
                  by (10, 10).&#160; Where will it appear?&#160; At (20, 20).&#160; You have now
                  defined a new local coordinate system for the child node with an origin
                  at&#160;(20, 20).&#160; Remember the bounds will still be at (0, 0) with respect
                  to the new local coordinate system.&#160; Check out the <a class="main_pane"
                  href="graphics.shtml#Matrix">Matrix Transformations</a> section of the Graphics
                  Primer to see what's really going on here.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, what exactly are bounds then?&#160; You can think of a node's bounds as a
                  rectangular bounding box that is guaranteed to be large enough to contain
                  whatever a node renders, which also happen to be stored in the local coordinate
                  system of the node.&#160; If you position a node by setting the <code>X</code>,
                  <code>Y</code>, <code>Width</code>, <code>Height</code>, or <code>Bounds</code>
                  properties, you are setting the node's bounds.&#160; Bounds are used by framework
                  for efficient rendering and picking and can be useful to Piccolo users as
                  well.&#160; Bounds are not hierarchical.&#160; In the above example if we set the
                  parent node's bounds to (10, 10), the parent will move to (10, 10), but the child
                  will not be affected since modifying a node's bounds will <b>not</b> change it's
                  coordinate system.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Setting a node's bounds will have different effects on different types of nodes,
                  depending on how they are implemented.&#160; But, in general, nodes will change
                  how the render to accommodate the new bounds.&#160; For example, setting the
                  bounds of a PImage will simply scale the rendered image to the new bounds.&#160;
                  Setting the bounds of a PText will clip the text.&#160; But, if the
                  <code>ConstrainWidthToTextWidth</code> or
                  <code>ConstrainHeightToTextHeight</code> flags are set, setting the width or
                  height respectively will have no effect.&#160; Finally, setting the bounds of a
                  PPath will scale the points to fit within the new bounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b class="dark_heading_two"><a name="q4" id="q4"></a>Why don't PPath's bounds
                  match the points in the path?</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  PPath contains a set of points that are rendered with a pen.&#160; But, the
                  bounds will not be exactly equal to the bounding box of the points in the
                  path.&#160; Remember, the bounds are at least as big as the object, they are
                  <b>not</b> a representation of the object.&#160; Since paths have a pen with a
                  default width of 1, the bounds will be the bounding box of the points in the
                  path, plus half the pen width on all sides (.5).&#160; So, what happens when you
                  set the bounds of a path?&#160; Piccolo will scale the points to fit within the
                  new bounds.&#160; So, if you set the width to 60, the rectangle will have a width
                  of 59, with the pen extending .5 on either side.

                  the following:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Extend the <code>PApplet</code> class<code>, located in the extras package,
                    and</code> add your piccolo code to the <code>initialize</code> method.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Compile your applet with piccolo.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Copy the Piccolo JARs and class files to a location on the webserver.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Finally create an html file with an applet tag to load the applet.&#160; If
                    your applet class was called MyApplet, the applet tag might look something like
                    this:<br />
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <pre>
     &lt;applet archive="piccolo.jar, piccolox.jar" code="MyApplet.class"
     width=200 height=100&gt;&lt;/applet&gt;
</pre><i>In Piccolo.NET,</i> 
                <p>
                  You can embed a .NET control, that uses piccolo, in Internet Explorer.&#160; The
                  .NET Runtime will need to be installed on the client machine.&#160; In practice,
                  this will limit you to windows-based clients.&#160; And, this approach will not
                  work with browsers other than Internet Explorer.

                  The . <a class="main_pane"
                  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnnetsec/html/netframesecover.asp">
                  NET security model</a> places additional restrictions on embedding controls in
                  Internet Explorer.&#160; If you are deploying your control locally, you won't
                  have too much trouble.&#160; But, if you are deploying it over the web, you might
                  run into some roadblocks.&#160; The default Internet Zone security settings on
                  most machines will not allow you to load external dlls, which will be a problem
                  if your applet references Piccolo.&#160; The default security settings also
                  restrict some of Piccolo's keyboard input code from running.&#160; To solve this
                  problem, you could have the client fully trust your site, or decrease their
                  security settings.&#160; But, that might not be desirable.&#160; Alternatively,
                  you can do a couple of hacks to get your control to work for most of the
                  world.&#160; This approach is described below.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Uncomment the line "#define WEB_DEPLOY" from PCanvas and recompile
                    Piccolo.NET.&#160; This will exclude any code that violates the default
                    Internet Zone settings.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Create a new class library project that references the DLLs created in step 1.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Extend PCanvas to create a new control.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Compile your project to create a new DLL that contains your control.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Merge your DLL with the Piccolo DLLs using a tool like <a class="main_pane"
                    href="http://research.microsoft.com/~mbarnett/ilmerge.aspx">ILMerge</a>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Copy the DLL created in step 5 to a location on the webserver.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Finally, create an html file with an object tag to load the control.&#160; If
                    your control class was called MyControl and you named the merged DLL Lib.dll,
                    then the object tag might look something like this:
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <pre>
     &lt;object classid="Lib.dll#MyControl" height="400" width="300"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;

                  results when I create two activities that act on the same object?</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each activity has a start time, which by default is set to the current
                  time.&#160; Suppose you call one of PNode's animate methods multiple times:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <code>node.AnimateToPositionScaleRotation(0, 150, 1, 0, 1000);<br />
                   node.AnimateToPositionScaleRotation(150, 0, 1, 0, 2000);</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                  You might think the node will first animate to (0, 150) and then animate to (150,
                  0).&#160; Instead, both activities occur simultaneously.&#160; Each time piccolo
                  processes activities, it will give both animations a chance to step.&#160; It
                  will move the node a bit in one direction and then a bit in the other
                  direction.&#160; But, since updates are merged, it will appear as if only the
                  first activity is executing.&#160; Then, since the second activity has a longer
                  duration, the node will jump to the middle of the second animation and
                  continue.&#160; This is probably not the intended behavior.&#160; The solution is
                  to set the start time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <code>PActivity a1 = n.AnimateToPositionScaleRotation(0, 150, 1, 0, 1400);<br />
                   PActivity a2 = n.AnimateToPositionScaleRotation(150, 0, 1, 0, 2000);<br />
                   a2.StartTime = a1.StartTime + a1.Duration;</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now, the node will animate all the way to (0, 150) and then to (150, 0), as
                  expected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b class="dark_heading_two"><a name="q8" id="q8"></a>How do I control the order
                  of activities?</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can control the order of activities by setting each activity's start
                  time.&#160; And, you can use the root node's global time as the current
                  time.&#160; So, if you want an activity to start four seconds from now, you could
                  do the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <code>activity.StartTime = Canvas.Root.GlobalTime + 4000;</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                  PActivity also has a convenience method to schedule an activity to start after
                  another activity:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <code>secondActivity.StartAfter(firstActivity);</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Internally, this just sets the start time of <code>secondActivity</code> to be
                  <code>firstActivity's</code> start time plus its duration.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b class="dark_heading_two"><a name="q9" id="q9"></a>Why is it safe to modify an
                  activity after I create it?</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  You might wonder why you can schedule an activity and then set its start time, or
                  any of its properties for that matter.&#160; The reason is because the activity
                  does not start running "immediately," even if its start time is set to the
                  current time.&#160; When you schedule an activity with the root or call an
                  animate method, the activity is added to an internal list stored in the
                  <code>PActivityScheduler</code> class.&#160; <code>PActivityScheduler</code> also
                  stores a windows timer.&#160; The scheduled activity will be given its first
                  chance to step the next time the timer fires, which will be some time after the
                  current method ends.
