   <TITLE>WordNet Java Viewer: A Graphic Browser for WordNet</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<!--#include virtual="/hcil/jazz/banner.html"-->

<P>WordNet Java Viewer is a graphic interactive tool for viewing <A
HREF="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/">WordNet</A> - a semantic
network of English senses.&nbsp; WordNet is a well recognized
linguistic tool, that has been on on-going development since 1985, at
Princeton university.&nbsp; WordNet is composed of four different
semantic networks: nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Each node in
the semantic networks is referred to as a 'synset' , that is a synonym
set. Synsets usually have a gloss (definition) of their meaning, and
various links to other sysnets. Such links include 'is-a' link
(Hypernym/Hyponym in the WordNet jargon), part-of, see-also and
others. For a complete description of WordNet or for downloading it,
check the WordNet web site.

<P>WordNet has more than ten different existing browsers (also
available at their web
site),&nbsp; most of them textual. WordNet Java Viewer enables access to the
different knowledge bits contained in WordNet, as well as a spatial
view on the network structure. The network is constructed as a graph,
using only the is-a links. WordNet Java Viewer uses the WordNet c api through
JNI&nbsp;code and relies heavily on Jazz classes for the display. In
constructing the complex graphs, it is only needed to construct the
logical representation - all the layout is managed by Jazz layout
mechanism. Jazz inherent zooming and panning also help manage the tens
of thousands nodes size networks.

<P>WordNet Java Viewer was designed and implemented by <A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~sperer">Ruth
Sperer</A>, a graduate student at the university of Maryland, under the
guidance of Prof. Ben Bederson.  For more information about this project, please

Screen Shots from WordNet Java Viewer.
The buttons initiate expansion of the hierarchy (child button brings
up children, >> button shows possible links).
The definition can be reached by double clicking the desired sense.
