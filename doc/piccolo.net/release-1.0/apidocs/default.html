<h1>Piccolo.NET</h1>
Piccolo.NET is a revolutionary way (in the Jazz ZUI tradition) 
to create robust, full-featured graphical applications in C#, with
striking features such as zooming and multiple representation. Piccolo.NET is an 
extensive toolkit based on the GDI+ API. And best of all, Piccolo.NET is not only
free, it's open source!<p>

Piccolo.NET is a general-purpose C#-based engine that supports 2D visualizations. 
A primary characteristic of Piccolo.NET is that it is designed to support zoomable 
information spaces, although any particular applications may or may not
take advantage of this feature. Piccolo.NET is implemented entirely in C#, 
and as such runs identically on any platform that supports the CLR. <p>

Piccolo.NET is not an application in itself, but rather it is an engine that is designed 
to support applications that require the ability to create, manipulate, and render 
object-oriented graphics. If you are familiar with the terminology of 3D graphics, 
Piccolo.NET supports a scenegraph. This is a data structure that represents a hierarchy 
of graphical objects. Piccolo.NET uses a tuned run-time system to render the scenegraph 
as quickly as possible to support interactive applications. <p>
