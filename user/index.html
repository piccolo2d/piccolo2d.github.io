          About Piccolo
        </h1>
        <p>
          <em>Welcome to Piccolo!</em> A revolutionary way to create robust, full-featured
          <em>graphical applications</em> in Java and C#, with striking visual effects such as
          <em>zooming, animation</em> and <em>multiple representations</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Piccolo is a toolkit that supports the development of 2D structured graphics programs, in
          general, and Zoomable User Interfaces (ZUIs), in particular. A ZUI is a new kind of
          interface that presents a huge canvas of information on a traditional computer display by
          letting the user smoothly zoom in, to get more detailed information, and zoom out for an
          overview. We use a "scene-graph" model that is common to 3D environments. Basically, this
          means that Piccolo maintains a hierarchal structure of objects and cameras, allowing the
          application developer to orient, group and manipulate objects in meaningful ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why use Piccolo? It will allow you to build structured graphical applications without
          worrying so much about the low level details. The infrastructure provides efficient
          repainting of the screen, bounds management, event handling and dispatch, picking
          (determining which visual object the mouse is over), animation, layout, and more.
          Normally, you would have to write all of this code from scratch. Additionally, if you
          want to build an application with zooming, that's built right into the framework too.
        </p>
        <p>
          What exactly is it? Piccolo is a layer built on top of a lower level graphics API. There
          are currently three versions of the toolkit: Piccolo.Java, Piccolo.NET and
          PocketPiccolo.NET (for the .NET Compact Framework). The java version is built on Java 2
          and relies on the Java2D API to do its graphics rendering. The .NET version is built on
          the .NET Framework and relies on the GDI+ API to do its graphics rendering. This makes it
          easy for Java and C# programmers, even those targeting PDAs, to build their own animated
          graphical applications. And best of all, Piccolo is <em>free</em> and <em>open
          source!</em>
        </p>

      <h2>
        How many versions of Piccolo are there?
      </h2>
      <p>
        There three versions of Piccolo: <em>Piccolo.Java</em>, <em>Piccolo.NET</em>, and
        <em>PocketPiccolo.NET</em>. They contain the same core functionality with a few
        differences. We will examine each separately here. For a detailed comparison, see
        <a href='comparison.shtml'>Piccolo in Comparison</a>.

      <dl>
        <dt>
          Piccolo.Java
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Piccolo.Java is written in 100% java, and the great thing about Java is that it runs on
          lots of machines including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Solaris. It is based on the
          Java2D API.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Piccolo.NET
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Piccolo.NET is written in 100% C#.&nbsp; It runs on platforms that support the .NET
          Framework.&nbsp; This means mainly Windows machines. Piccolo.NET provides the same
          functionality as Piccolo.Java, enabling .NET users to easily integrate advanced 2D
          graphics and zooming with standard Windows application code.&nbsp; It is a deep port of
          the&nbsp;&nbsp;Java version.&nbsp; The API is very similar,&nbsp;&nbsp;but there
          are&nbsp;a few differences to better support .NET style guidelines and constructs.&nbsp;
          Piccolo.NET is based on the GDI+ API.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          PocketPiccolo.NET
        </dt>
        <dd>
          PocketPiccolo.NET is also written in C#.&nbsp; It runs on platforms that support the
          Compact .NET Framework.&nbsp; This means mainly PDAs.&nbsp; Current platforms include
          Pocket PCs, Pocket PC Phones, Smart Phones, and Windows CE.NET devices.

      <h2>
        What do you mean by "Structured Graphics"?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Piccolo provides support for developers of 2D (+ zooming) object-oriented graphics programs
        in Java and C#. It uses a "scenegraph" model that is common to 3D environments. Basically,
        this means that Piccolo keeps a hierarchal structure of objects and cameras. Each node in
        the hierarchy has a general 2D affine transform which allows every object to be arbitrarily
        translated, scaled, rotated, and sheared. In addition, the cameras have affine transforms
        that specify their view into the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        This simple approach is very powerful because is enables a very decoupled object oriented
        approach to graphical applications. Piccolo defines several visual components, and
        applications can readily extend them or define their own. Piccolo supports dynamic and
        constrained objects that respond to various kinds of context (such as the current camera
        view). And, the camera model supports multiple views, overviews, and even embedded views
        (where a camera looks at another camera within the scene).
      </p>
      <h2>
        What development directions are you following?
      </h2>
      <p>
        We are continuing to expand and maintain all three versions of Piccolo.&nbsp; But,
        internally, most of our new research projects are being implemented in Piccolo.NET.
      </p>
      <h2>
        How do I get a Piccolo License?
      </h2>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h2>
        Where did Piccolo come from?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Ken Perlin at New York University came up with the initial zoomable surface concept. He and
        David Fox implemented the first versions of <em>Pad</em> (described in the 1993 SIGGRAPH
        paper available <a href='publications.shtml'>here</a>). Perlin and Fox's original work was
        supported in part originally by NYNEX, and then NSF.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next major step was <em>Pad++</em>, designed by Ben Bederson and Jim Hollan while at
        Bellcore. They both moved to the University of New Mexico where they developed the bulk of
        Pad++ in collaboration with Jon Meyer and Ken Perlin at NYU. This was supported largely by
        a DARPA initiative in HCI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then there was <em>Jazz</em>, a rewrite in Java by Ben Bederson and his team at the
        University of Maryland. It was a rich toolkit and supported all kinds of features including
        embedded Swing widgets and SVG. However, it grew too big, and more importantly it had a
        very general design that actually made it somewhat hard to use because there were so many
        objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Piccolo</em>, the current incarnation, is a direct successor to Jazz. Piccolo takes all
        that we have learned over the years, and rolls it into a lean and mean tiny engine that is
        very easy to understand, use and extend. It was built by&nbsp; Jesse Grosjean and then
        ported to .NET by Aaron Clamage under the direction of Ben Bederson at the University of
        Maryland.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What happened to Jazz?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Jazz has lived a healthy and prosperous life.&nbsp; It has enabled us to perform our
        research on Zoomable User Interfaces, and it has spawned a new toolkit, Piccolo.&nbsp;
        Piccolo is now replacing Jazz and now supports everything Jazz does (except embedded Swing
        widgets which we never found to be crucial anyway).&nbsp; Jazz remains open source, and we
        will keep it on this website but we are not actively maintaining it, and are instead
        focusing all of our current efforts on Piccolo.
